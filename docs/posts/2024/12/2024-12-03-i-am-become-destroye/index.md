now not only amazon, councils (via parking charges), govs (via bans on car parking for new builds) are decimating your high st the latest threat is aliexpress image search

(hope you get the [oppenheimer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) joke)

just went into my local corner shop and scanned a blue tooth speaker £40 (aliexpress price £20) and a iphone usb charger £15 (aliexpress £3)

why not "change the way you shop (@selfridges)" with your android, iphone, goog chrome browser or ms edge browser today and save 80%
