Want a version of Linux for your Intel Atom powered “NetBook” – aka Asus Eee PC type subnotebook? Canonical hopes that Ubuntu Remix will fit the bill for OEMs – and presumably users, too - and has launched it at Computex in Taiwan.

Canonical recently announced their development of Ubuntu Netbook Remix as [covered by my colleague Alex Zaharov-Reutt](http://www.itwire.com/content/view/18597/1103/ "Ubuntu Netbook Remix announced"). This is a special release of Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) which is targeted at what they dub ‘netbooks.’_

_Until Canonical made their announcement there really was no Linux distro specifically aimed at this segment of devices. This is why ASUS made their own Xandros derivative, which, while not having licensing costs, did involve research and development time. It is not hard to imagine that a future Eee, particularly if it is based on the Atom processor, would also ship with Ubuntu’s targeted operating system especially because it too aims to eke the best result out of the Atom processor.
