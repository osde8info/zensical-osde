The secret is out ! The M$ "Universal" Logo (a yin yang [copied/stolen from Apple](http://www.chewontech.com/2007/07/microsoft-steals-apple-universal-logo.html) ?) on the Microsoft 2000 USB Wireless Keyboard and Mouse means it **doesn't** need drivers and therefore **will** work with your BIOS and if you are running GNU/Linux or Apple Mac OS-X !

It would have been nice if they had just written GNU/Linux compatible on the outside of the box !  
  
Why can't all USB hardware be this easy ? And who was the genius who put the CapsLock and NumLock LEDs on the transmitter to save battery power in the keyboard !  
  
If your local Tesco's has sold out of the £20 version Amazon are still selling them for £35[

PS I've just noticed it thinks my UK keyboard has a US layout - I'll have to try and fix that !
