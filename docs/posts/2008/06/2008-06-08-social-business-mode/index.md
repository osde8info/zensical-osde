The **Social Business** Model  
[http://advogato.org/article/971.html](http://advogato.org/article/971.html)

_The space in which we live, breathe and enjoy our lives is our planet, and our expertise in technology is invaluable. We cannot afford to sit back and "remain aloof" with our focus on "open standards" whilst the rest of the world goes mad with PMB-driven greed around us, taking us with them.None of the existing models which are currently in prevalent use, world-wide, for sustaining human development and life, are going to make it._

_In particular, none of them are suited to helping us take on PMBs; none of them provide us with a viable opportunity to take over from PMBs; none of them support us (with our integrity and our self-esteem intact) to help the average person... ... except for the "**Social Business**" concept.
