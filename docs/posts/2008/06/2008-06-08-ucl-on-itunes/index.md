[UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk) has taken a leading step forward in opening up its educational impact to the world.

It has today launched its platform on [iTunes U](http://itunes.ucl.ac.uk/) through which users can download lectures, interviews, seminars and news, and play audio and video materials on their iPod or computer. Until now, only North American institutions have featured on [iTunes U](http://itunes.ucl.ac.uk/).

The new partnership between [UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and Apple makes [UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/) the first mainstream UK university (and one of only three European universities, with Trinity College Dublin and the Open University) to pioneer global participation in [iTunes U](http://itunes.ucl.ac.uk/).
