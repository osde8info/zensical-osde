I hope this blog illustrates my last blog about the [demise of Google](http://osde-info.vox.com/library/post/the-demise-of-google.html) !

Here are a few great links that I found via del.icio.us instead of google :

So how did i use del.icio.us to find these ?

I just did it the Web 2.0 / Social Media Network / Web 3.0 way and just looked at other links from the first 30 people in the world to del.ici.ify about the [Google Earth Monster Milk Truck Game](http://osde-info.vox.com/library/post/google-earth-monster-milk-truck-game.html) !

You might find it rewarding to add those 30 people to your del.icio.us network too !
