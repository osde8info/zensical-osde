Skype gives up fight against GPL  
Thu, 08 May 2008  
[Skype withdraws appeals case, judgement from lower court accepted](http://laforge.gnumonks.org/weblog/2008/05/08#20080508-olg_muenchen-skype)  

_The court hearing in the "Welte vs. Skype Technologies SA" case went pretty well. Initially the court again suggested that the two parties might reach some form of amicable agreement. We indicated that this has been discussed before and we're not interested in settling for anything less than full GPL compliance._

_The various arguments by Skype supporting their claim that the GPL is violating German anti-trust legislation as well as further claims aiming at the GPL being invalid or incompatible with German legislation were not further analyzed by the court.  
_

_The court stated that there was not enough arguments and material brought forward by Skype to support such a claim. And even if there was some truth to that, then Skype would not be able to still claim usage rights under that very same license._
