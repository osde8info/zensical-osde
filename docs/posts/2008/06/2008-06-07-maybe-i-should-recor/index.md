Yesterday I phoned one of my broadband suppliers and they said they were "sorry" for the 24 hr outage but that I couldn't cancel my contract until December but would I like a "free" Wi-Fi modem router worth £40 ?

(Stupidly) I slept on the deal and phoned them back today only to told they "never" gave away Wi-Fi routers but they could offer me 25p compensation and that I could "cancel" my account at any time !

I'll be recording my calls for QA purposes from now on ! So make sure you listen for that beep !
