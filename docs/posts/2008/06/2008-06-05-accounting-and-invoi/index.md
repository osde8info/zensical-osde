There is now a choice of free libre open source software that you can use for Accounting and Invoicing for small medium business's (SMBs) and small medium enterprises (SMEs):

- [Bamboo Invoice](http://www.bambooinvoice.org/) which is especially nice since it is built around the CodeIgniter PHP framework  
    
- [Simple Invoices](http://www.simpleinvoices.org/)  
    
- [Ledger SMB](http://ledgersmb.org/)
