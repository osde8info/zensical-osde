Fill in the gaps in your flickr, del.icio.us, pownce, last.fm social media network mesh by just logging in to your MyBlogLog and goto your MyBlogLog Connector page [http://www.mybloglog.com/user/connector](http://www.mybloglog.com/user/connector)

_Connector helps you fill in the connection gaps with your friends across the services you use. If you're friends on MyBlogLog, you probably should be friends on the other services you use. This will help you do just that._

_Click a green plus icon (![Click to Connect](http://l.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/nt/ic/ut/bsc/add16_nrm_1.gif)) below to connect to a friend at a service.  
_

_If you want to open all connections with a friend, click a green arrow icon (![Connect on All Services](http://dev.mybloglog.com/jsampson/buzz/images/green_arrow.png)) and multiple windows will open with your friend's profiles.  
_

_As oAuth becomes available, we will be able to make connections without opening a new window._
