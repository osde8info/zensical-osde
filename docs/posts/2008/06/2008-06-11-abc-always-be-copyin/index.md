**A New Moto for System Administrators  
**I noticed that [nj\_dodge](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nj_dodge/) and [ekarjala](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ekarjala/) have created a flickr group [ABC - Always Be Capturing](http://www.flickr.com/groups/alwaysbecapturing/) possibly inspired from the sales persons favorite moto "Always Be Closing" featured in the film Glengarry Glen Ross !

So following on from recent real world System Administration experience I've thought I'd try to come up with a ABC moto for SysAdmins !  
  
First I thought of:  
  

- **Always Be Backing Up**  
    

but the TLA of this is ABBU instead of ABC so I then thought of changing it slighty  
  

- **Always Be Copying**
- **Always Be Cloning** (too virtualisation specific ?)  
    

are there any better ABC motos for SysAdmins ?
