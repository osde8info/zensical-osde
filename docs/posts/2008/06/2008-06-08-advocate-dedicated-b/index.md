## Why does [Advogato](http://advogato.org/faq.html) exist?

_Advogato is intended to be a community site and social networking site for free software developers. When Raph Levien created Advogato, he said, **While "Advogato" is a pun on the word "advocate," the goal of this site is quite different than the usual sense of OS advocacy or free software advocacy. Advogato's advocacy is for developers of free software: to make life more enjoyable, the work more satisfying, and to help balance the tension between the free nature of the enterprise and the human need for tangible compensation. Advogato doesn't care about the market share growth percent of the free software operating systems. What Advogato cares about is how to make the best use of the opportunities, and deal with the challenges, that this growth is creating.**_

_Advogato also serves a testing ground for the use of trust metrics for peer certification._

## Who is [Advogato](http://advogato.org/faq.html) for?

_Advogato is for, to paraphrase Neal Stephenson, the sort of people who inhabit the intersections of Venn diagrams. Primarily the intersection of people with an interest in free software and open source (FOSS).  
_

_The diagram in question was created by Hung Chao-Kuei for the Free Software Foundation and graphically represents the relationship between software distribution and licensing methods._

Maybe I should split my time betwen [Advogato](http://advogato.org/faq.html) and VOX but my time is in short supply !
