Put simply (?) [gforge](http://gforge.org/projects/gforge/) is a continuation / fork of the **discontinued** free libre open source source [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alexandria-dev/) 2.6 !

[gforge](http://gforge.org/projects/gforge/) [says](http://gforge.org/docman/view.php/1/34/gforge_manual.pdf):  

> _GForge is a fork of the 2.61 SourceForge code, which was only available via anonymous CVS from VA  
> (Research|Linux|Software). <gforge.org> is not a project hosting platform, it is merely an implementation  
> of the GForge code. We believe that the GForge functionality is important not only to the Open  
> Source community, but to the wider business community._
> 
> _The GForge project was formed and is maintained by Tim Perdue, the original author of much of the  
> original SourceForge web code._  

[sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alexandria-dev/) [says](http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=10382&group_id=39306):  

1. _What is the state of the source code to SourceForge?_
    
    _The source code powering SourceForge.net, SourceForge 2.6, was the last version of SourceForge source code publicly available as Open Source software. In November 2001, VA Software announced SourceForge Enterprise Edition 3.0, a proprietary version of SourceForge._
    
2. _Why has VA decided to close the SourceForge codebase?_
    
    _Several factors have shaped this decision, including a change in our core business from systems and services to software, and repeated instances of use and extension of the Open Source codebase by companies who declined to share their improvements. How are companies able to do this without violating the GPL? Since they never release their changes outside the company, they are not compelled to give their code back to the community. Unfortunately, this impedes our ability to do business as the developer of the SourceForge application._
    
3. _How does SourceForge 2.7 compare to the SourceForge 3.x codebase?_
    
    _SourceForge 2.7 contains cleaned code and bug fixes, building on the SourceForge 2.6 release. It does not contain Oracle database support, pervasive search functionality, documentation management, user-configurable reporting, integrated source control-issue tracking and automatic installation capabilities available only with the commercial, SourceForge Enterprise Edition 3.0 product offering._
    
4. _What does this mean for OSDN?_
    
    _This decision was made in close consultation with OSDN. OSDN continues to focus on supporting the development, distribution and discussion of Open Source software, and will continue to operate SourceForge.net as a service for the Open Source and Free Software communities._
    
5. _What codebase will SourceForge.net run on?_
    
    _Given the need to scale to support tens of thousands of development projects, SourceForge.net will be upgrading to the SourceForge 3.x codebase._
    

Does that make it all clear now ? But whats the difference between gforge.com, gforge.org, gforge express & [gforgegroup.com](https://gforgegroup.com/) ? "_Now **anyone** can create a private project on GForge AS easily and instantly. No need to set up your own server or pay any fees. GForge Group is providing a free, 75MB GForge AS project space with up to 5 developers and a subversion tree at [http://gforge.com/](http://gforge.com/gf/register/?action=ProjectAdd)."
