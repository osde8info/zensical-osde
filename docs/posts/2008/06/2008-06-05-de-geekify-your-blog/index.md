Are your blogs a bit too geeky or techie ?

I know many people have said my Virtualisation ([VIZZ.INFO](http://vizz.info/)) and VOIP ([VOIPPIX.INFO](http://voippix.info/)) blogs are ! So I've just discovered how to de-geekify them by using two lines of JavaScript to add widgets provided by [MyBlogLog](http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/osde-info/) !

Here's what my VOIP blog now looks like with a super user friendly "recent visitor" section (in dark blue @ top right) and a "my personal profile" section (in green @ bottom right) !

Does this [blog](http://voippix.info/) look less (or more) geeky now ?
