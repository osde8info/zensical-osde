[BitNami](http://bitnami.org/stacks) stacks are not VMs or software appliances but _make it incredibly easy to install your favorite open source software. Application stacks include an open source application and all the dependencies necessary to run it, such as Apache, MySQL and PHP or Ruby. All you need to do is download the Stack, provide a few pieces of information when prompted by the installation wizard, and that's it. By the time you click 'finish', your new application will be ready to run. All stacks have been packaged using BitRock's [multiplatform installer](http://bitrock.com/products_installbuilder_overview.html)._

For example there are BitNami stacks for :

- [Drupal](http://bitnami.org/stack/drupal) Content Management  
    
- [RedMine](http://bitnami.org/stack/redmine) Project Management
