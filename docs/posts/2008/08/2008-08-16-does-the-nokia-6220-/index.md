The NOKIA 6220 advert on [three.co.uk](http://threestore.three.co.uk/) says:  
  

> _You'll never miss a moment with the Nokia 6220 because it comes with a 5mp camera and Xenon flash to capture anything and everything you want_
> 
> _Not only this, but the 6220 has built in GPS, UK Nokia maps and **geotagging capability** for when you're rushing around on the move. There'll be no chance of you ever getting lost again_
> 
> _If you like keeping yourself informed by browsing the web and receiving emails, you can now do it from your mobile at broadband speeds on 3's Turbo (HSPDA) network. Chat to your friends on Windows Live Messenger, share your photos on Facebook, or use any of the many applications the 6220 comes with like Skype, and access to eBay and Google_

but does this mean it really geotags your photo's when you take them ?

If so @ £15 / month (for 18 months) I'll be buying one tomorrow !
