The [Pardus](http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/projects/index.html) 2008 Turkish GNU/Linux distro is even better than the 2007 version and very different from many other GNU/Linux distros ! This is not just because it is from Turkey and has a Turkish focus but also because it uses ÇOMAR**,** YALI, PiSi, zorg and comes with (real) Sun Java 1.6.0 pre-installed ! Already there are 100+ (160MB+) of automatic update packages that you can download including a kernel update from 2.6.25.9 to 2.6.25.14 !

And it displays a very cute pussy cat animation while you are downloading updates !
