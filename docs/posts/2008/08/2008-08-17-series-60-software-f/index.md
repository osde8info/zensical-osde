If you have a Series 60 mobile phone with GPS or bluetooth GPS such as a NOKIA 6220 you can help [OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/) by uploading GPX tracks. First you need to upload some [Series 60 GPS tracking software](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Making_GPX_Tracks#Series_60_Software_.28for_Bluetooth_GPS.27s.29) to your mobile then you can start posting your tracks to [OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/).
