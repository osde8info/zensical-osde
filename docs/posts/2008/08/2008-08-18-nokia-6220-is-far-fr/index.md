NOKIA have still got **a lot** of ironing out to do to their 6220 Symbian S60 GSM 850/900/1800 WCDMA 900/2100 mobile phone before it becomes usable !

For starters each App uses a different (or multiple keys/menus to Exit) !

- Exit menu, Red key, CANCEL key, Options | Exit etc etc

and I have already accidently disconnected Skype, GPS, Maps dozens of times !

Each App uses a different key to zoom in & out !

- Up/Down, \*/#, 1/3 etc etc

Have NOKIA heard of usability guidelines ?

It trys to be clever and turn on GPS when you use maps or the camera but the only way to turn GPS off (and the annoying blue light) after it has automatically come on is to go into maps and Options | Exit !

So when's the first service pack due ?
