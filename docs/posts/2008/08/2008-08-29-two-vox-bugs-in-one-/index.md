In addition to my VOX ghost groups I have discovered VOX doesn't like spaces in photo filenames !

See [http://osde-info.vox.com/library/post/google-map-widget-by-xantus.html](http://osde-info.vox.com/library/post/google-map-widget-by-xantus.html)

  
I also managed to get this error by open 8 posts from my library in separate tabs and trying to add them to the same group !
