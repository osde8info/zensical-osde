Completely Automated Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans Apart = CAPTCHA

[http://www.captcha.net/](http://www.captcha.net/)

_The term CAPTCHA (for Completely Automated Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans Apart) was coined in 2000 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper and John Langford of Carnegie Mellon University. At the time, they developed the first CAPTCHA to be used by Yahoo._

Carnegie Mellon University claim to have a [CAPTCHA plugin for wordpress](http://recaptcha.net/plugins/wordpress/) but is it open source ? If not why not ? and if so where can i get the source code (instead of just an [API key](https://admin.recaptcha.net/recaptcha/createsite/)) from ? Finally I completely disagree with their "win-win" scenario. In my view if AI cracks the code then it becomes useless !

Here are some other Turing Test variants that already seem useless (in their present form) to me :
