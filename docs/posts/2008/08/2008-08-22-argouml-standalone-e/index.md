[ArgoUML](http://argouml.tigris.org/) is an open source UML modeling tool and includes support for all standard UML 1.4 diagrams. It runs on any Java platform and is available in ten languages. [ArgoUML](http://argouml.tigris.org/) was installed half a million times during 2005 and is in use all over the world.

There is even an [ArgoEclipse](http://argoeclipse.tigris.org/) project which provides integration between the Eclipse IDE and the UML components of ArgoUML. Instead of a standalone application, all [ArgoUML](http://argouml.tigris.org/) functionality is available tightly integrated within the IDE.
