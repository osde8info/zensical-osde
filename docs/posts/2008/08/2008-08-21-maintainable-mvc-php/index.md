The [Maintainable MVC PHP Framework](http://framework.maintainable.com/mvc/1_intro.php) is a based around the Model-View-Controller pattern and is modeled after Ruby on Rails. It aims for compatibility with PHP version 5.1.4 and later.

_The Maintainable PHP Framework was originally built only for their own projects, then released to open source at the request of their customers. Like any framework, it's certainly not appropriate for every application._

Maintainable MVC also includes phpunit.de based unit tests.
