The [Miro](http://www.getmiro.com/) video player is open-source and built by a non-profit and during its install includes [I Heart Miro](http://www.getmiro.com/) which is _a simple Firefox extension that gives a referral fee to the Miro organization when you shop at Amazon.  You'll never notice it, it doesn't cost you a thing, and it's easy to uninstall at any time.  
_  
I wonder if there are any other Firefox add-ons that do the same - but dont tell you they are doing it !
