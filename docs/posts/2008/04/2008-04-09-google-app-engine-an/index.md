**[What is Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine.html)**_Google App Engine lets you run your web applications on Google's infrastructure. App Engine applications are easy to build, easy to maintain, and easy to scale as your traffic and data storage needs grow. With App Engine, there are no servers to maintain: You just upload your application, and it's ready to serve your users._
