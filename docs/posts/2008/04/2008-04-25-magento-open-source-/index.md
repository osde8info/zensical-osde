[](http://www.magentocommerce.com/)[Magento](http://www.magentocommerce.com/) _was designed with the notion that each eCommerce implementation has to be unique since no two businesses are alike. Magento's modular architecture puts the control back in the hands of the online merchant and places no constraints on business processes and flow._  
[Varien](http://www.magentocommerce.com/company/) _is fully invested in establishing Magento as the leading Open Source eCommerce platform. To that effect, we are committed to nurturing the growth of the Magento community, building strong and lasting partnerships and continuing to develop and improve on Magento._
