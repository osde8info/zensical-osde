[Google Apps](http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/index.html) now includes [Google Sites](http://sites.google.com/) which makes creating a team site as easy as editing a document.  

_Use [Google Sites](http://sites.google.com/) to centralize all types of information -- from videos to presentations -- and share your site with just a few people, your entire organization, or the world. Create a single place to bring together all the information your team needs to share, including docs, videos, photos, calendars and attachments._

_Work togetherInvite co-workers, classmates, or your entire organization to edit your site with you to keep it fresh and up-to-date and let as many or few people view your site as you want._
