M$ has [announced](http://www.microsoft.com/germany/presseservice/detail.mspx?id=532144) the German launch of its new IE8 beta 1, and [XING is among the initial launch partners](http://blog.xing.com/2008/04/the-new-interne.html?dpt=ma&ttp=wnlnews&plf=mcrsft&xtr=20080414).

The new Internet Explorer comes with two new great functions, “WebSlices” and “Activities”. Sections of the XING website are now available as Webslices (visitors to my profile, messages and contacts to confirm) and the XING keyword search is an “Activity” integrated into IE8 !
