Oracle have created [Oracle Mix](https://mix.oracle.com/) a business media network for Oracle, PeopleSoft and Siebel customers and users.

There are hundreds of sub groups for DBAs, PHP, Oracle Xen VM, SQL Developer etc etc. You can see a list of sub groups i've join on my [Oracle Mix](https://mix.oracle.com/) profile @ [https://mix.oracle.com/user\_profiles/20195-clive-darra](https://mix.oracle.com/user_profiles/20195-clive-darra)
