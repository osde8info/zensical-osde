Open Source Software (apart from Red Hat & Ubuntu !) suffers from a massive lack of marketing ! For example I've been using Parallels Plesk and WHM/Cpanel for managing webhosting for many years without even realising there alternatives such as the lightweight LxLabs [LxAdmin](http://lxlabs.com/software/lxadmin/full-feature/) and the Open Source Webmin [VirtualMin](http://www.webmin.com/virtualmin.html) !

Well that changes today ! I will be giving Webmin [VirtualMin](http://www.webmin.com/virtualmin.html) a try and hope it lives up to its promises ! BUT hang on a mo ! They aren't making any "marketing" promises ! So how can they fail to live up to them ?
