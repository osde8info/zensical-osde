# [How does BT Openzone relate to BT FON?](http://btsupport.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/btsupport.cfg/php/enduser/cci/bt_adp.php?p_sid=NMxH432j&p_faqid=10997&cat_lvl1=1812&p_cv=1.1812&p_cats=1812)

  
_BT Total Broadband customers who are members of BT FON can use their Wi-Fi minutes to access BT Openzone hotspots as well as BT FON hotspots.

# [Do I have to be a BT Total Broadband customer to join BT FON?](http://btsupport.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/btsupport.cfg/php/enduser/cci/bt_adp.php?p_sid=NMxH432j&p_faqid=10997&cat_lvl1=1812&p_cv=1.1812&p_cats=1812)

  
_If you are not a BT Total Broadband customer, you can access the BT FON network by buying a BT Openzone voucher at [www.btopenzone.com/buy](http://www.btopenzone.com/buy)._   
  

# [Can BT FONero's use BT FON abroad?](http://btsupport.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/btsupport.cfg/php/enduser/cci/bt_adp.php?p_sid=NMxH432j&p_faqid=10899&cat_lvl1=1812&p_cv=1.1812&p_cats=1812)

  
_Yes you can connect to broadband at any FON hotspot around the world - anywhere that you see the "FON" Wi-Fi signal. Go to [www.bt.com/btfon](http://www.bt.com/btfon) to see hotspot maps of the world.

_

But why is this a **one way** deal and **why can't normal FON users** use the [BT FON](https://www.beta.bt.com/apps/openwifi/) & BT OpenZone networks ?
