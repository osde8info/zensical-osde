**Site Map**  
In general, there are **two** types of sitemaps:  

1. _The first type of sitemap is a **HTML page** listing the pages of your site - often by section - and is meant to help users find the information they need._
2. _The second type are **XML Sitemaps** - usually called Sitemaps, with a capital S - are a way for you to give search engines more information about your site._

**Site Map Index**  
If you have a lot of pages and only some change frequently then a sitemapindex file is useful

_You can list the URLs that change frequently in a small number of Sitemaps and then use the [lastmod](http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.php#lastmoddef) tag in your [Sitemap index file](http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.php#index) to identify those Sitemap files. Search engines can then incrementally crawl only the changed Sitemaps._
