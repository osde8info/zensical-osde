The [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/a/) Team automatically monitor **abuse@yourdomain.com** and **postmaster@yourdomain.com** to ensure that they can properly address all reports of spam, abuse, and technical issues.

If you'd like a copy of messages sent to **abuse@yourdomain.com** and **postmaster@yourdomain.com**, [create email lists](http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=33329) for both addresses, and add yourself as a recipient:

- abuse @ your.domain     Email list     2 recipients   Google Support,your-admin-user
- postmaster @ your.domain    Email list     2 recipients   Google Support,your-admin-user

Since **abuse** and **postmaster** are reserved aliases, you won't be able to use them as usernames or nicknames. If you'd also like to trap emails sent to **admin** and **webmaster** click on User Accounts chose your-admin-user and create an aliases for **admin** and **webmaster** by adding nicknames for **admin** and **webmaster** !
