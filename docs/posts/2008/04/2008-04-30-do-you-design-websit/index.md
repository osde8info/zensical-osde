Are you a web designer or graphic designer and do people keep bugging you to build their websites or design logos ?  
Do you have to keep appologising you don't have the time to help them ?

Well now you **can** help them by sending them to GoDaddy :

- [https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/logo/landing.asp](https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/logo/landing.asp)

and if you are currently charging more than $500 you might have to expect a lot of competition or even have to review your pricing !
