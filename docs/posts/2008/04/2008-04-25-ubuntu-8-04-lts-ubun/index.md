[Ubuntu 8.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-8.04-lts-server) LTS (Long Term Support) Desktop and Server Editions are now available !

If you want to run Ubuntu VM guests you might be very interested in [Ubuntu Server Edition JeOS](http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/serveredition/jeos) or if you want a lightweight Ubuntu for old low spec hardware (ie PII with 256M of RAM) you could try [Xubuntu](http://www.xubuntu.com/) !
