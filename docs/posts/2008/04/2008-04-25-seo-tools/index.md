The SEO company [instantPOSITION](http://www.instantposition.com/seotest.php) have a number of free-to-use tools you can use to check SEO of your site including:

> [SEO Tester](http://www.instantposition.com/seotest.php)  
> _The mini SEO Tester will check your server response, title tag, meta description tag and keywords._  
> _Gives you a score and summary of the optimization level of your page._
> 
> [Links Checker](http://www.instantposition.com/links_spider.cfm)  
> _Verify your links and the anchor text used for any page._  

Most of my sites get pretty low scores !

Maybe I should follow their suggestions ? or try some other tools from

[http://tools.seobook.com/](http://tools.seobook.com/) such as [http://www.websitegrader.com/](http://www.websitegrader.com/)
