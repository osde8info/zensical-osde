[O2 The Memory Project](http://www.o2memoryproject.com/#/)

Your chance to get inside a piece of photo/video art ! If you are in Edinburgh this weekend (26-27 Apr 08) "pop into" this piece of art ! If not then view the [O2 The Memory Project](http://www.o2memoryproject.com/#/) 24 hour x 360 degrees Adobe Flash animation on the web !

It's a very arty/flashy/trendy Adobe Flash presentation and it is not very obvious how to navigate through it !

Here are some tips:  
   

- click on a city
- then  
    
- move your mouse UP and DOWN to go forwards and back in time
- or
- move your mouse LEFT or RIGHT to rotate through 360 degrees
