[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) is an SCM designed to be an easy replacement for CVS, while addressing some of its shortcomings.

Here are some [reasons why Gnome chose](http://live.gnome.org/SubversionFAQ) [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) as a replacement for CVS after nearly 10 years:

- _Directories, renames, and file meta-data are versioned_
- _Commits are truly atomic_
- _Branching and tagging are cheap (constant time) operations_
- _Natively client/server, layered library design_
- _Client/server protocol sends diffs in both directions_
- _Costs are proportional to change size, not data size_
- _Versioning of symbolic links_
- _Efficient handling of binary files_
- _Parseable output_
- _Localized messages_
