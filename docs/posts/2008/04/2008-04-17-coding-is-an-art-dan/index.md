**[Coding Is An Art](http://daniel.haxx.se/hackers.html)**

_I consider coding an art. I really do. Good coders are cool people and coders who aren't good shouldn't be paid to code. Good coders are not as popular nor important today that I'd like them to be. Quality code is usually a forgotten issue in the huge corporate developing of today. All people are thought to do equally good. I wish people one day will realize that some people do better code, some do worse code. I'll become more appreciated that day._

_You simply aren't a skilled programmer after a few years in college. You need time and time in front of a computer  
bent over a keyboard. You need hundreds of hard hours hacking._
