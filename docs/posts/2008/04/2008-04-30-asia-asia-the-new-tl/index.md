**What is .ASIA ?**

[http://www.dotster.com/domains/asia/asiafaq](http://www.dotster.com/domains/asia/asiafaq "blocked::http://www.dotster.com/domains/asia/asiafaq")

_Asia is a new TLD that enables companies and individuals to show a presence in the Asia/Pacific region. A .ASIA domain name provides a way to expand your online business by reaching out to the hundreds of millions of International Internet users in the ICANN designated Asia-Pacific countries_  
_  
Anyone (person or entity) can be a registrant of .ASIA domains. In order to satisfy the .ASIA Charter Eligibility Requirement, one of the associated contacts for the domain (registrant, administrative, technical or billing contact) must be a legal entity in ASIA. A legal entity may be a natural person of a juristic entity such as a corporation._  

  
There is already seems to be an auction running at [http://asia.asia/](http://asia.asia/) for some of the .asia domains !
