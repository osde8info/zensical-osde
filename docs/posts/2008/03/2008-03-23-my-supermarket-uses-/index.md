Now you can do your supermarket shopping online and compare **other** supermarket prices at the same time by using [mysupermarket](http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/Administration/AboutUs.aspx) !

#### _Why use [mySupermarket](http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/)?_

_You still select items, buy them and get delivery from your usual supermarket - but you have much more control over the contents and price of your trolley.Your shopping experience will be easier and your wallet better off:_

- _Find what you want with a consumer friendly image-based shelf display_
- _Watch your potential savings increase while you shop_
- _Keep an eye on how much your trolley costs in the other supermarkets_
- _Switch your entire trolley seamlessly to any other supermarket, or_
- _Don't switch: stay in your usual supermarket and use the 'Price Checker' feature to check whether you can swap some of your items for others on special offer or better value._
- _You can also use the 'Health Checker' feature to check whether you can swap some of your items for similar products with fewer calories, or lower salt, sugar, fat or saturated fat._
- _Find all the offers and deals in one place in the Special Offers Department._

and according to term 3.20.2 of their [TermsAndConditions](http://www.mysupermarket.com/Administration/TermsAndConditions.aspx) they use AI to make your shopping more healthy !

- _we may offer you alternative items which are more healthy (meaning that the traffic lights Health Information **generally** show a more healthy alternative **on balance**, although some particular traffic light colours among the mix, may signal that one or more aspects may be less healthy; however, **on balance** the traffic light health signalling will be more healthy in our view and we bias our health algorithm towards lower fat content)_

They even have their own WordPress blog @ [http://mysupermarket.wordpress.com/](http://mysupermarket.wordpress.com/)
