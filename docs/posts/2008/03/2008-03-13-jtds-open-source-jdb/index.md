[jTDS](http://jtds.sourceforge.net/) is an open source 100% pure Java (type 4) JDBC 3.0 driver for MS SQL Server (6.5, 7, 2000 and 2005) and Sybase (10, 11, 12, 15). jTDS is based on [FreeTDS](http://www.freetds.org/) and is currently the fastest production-ready JDBC driver for MS SQL Server and Sybase.

jTDS is 100% JDBC 3.0 compatible, supporting forward-only and scrollable/updateable `ResultSet`s, concurrent (completely independent) `Statement`s and implementing all the `DatabaseMetaData` and `ResultSetMetaData` methods.

jTDS is used in a number of commercial applications. It has been tested with and is actually recommended as the driver to use for MS SQL Server by pretty much all open source AND commercial database management tools:

- iSQL-Viewer ([http://isql.sourceforge.net](http://isql.sourceforge.net))
- SQL Workbench/J (http://www.sql-workbench.net)
- SQuirreL SQL Client ([http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net](http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net))
- Db-Visualizer (http://www.minq.se/products/dbvis/index.html)
- SQL Developer (http://sqldeveloper.solyp.com)
- Artiso Visual Case (http://www.visualcase.com)

  
There are quite a few database management tools that come bundled together with jTDS:

- DataDino (http://www.datadino.com/)
- DBInspect (http://www.dbinspect.com/)
- Aqua Data Studio (http://www.aquafold.com/)
- DB Viewer (http://victorpendleton.net/products/dbviewer.html)
