_The standards provide specific guidelines of the mounting hole pattern placement, screw size, and guidelines for the mounting pad or mounting apparatus to be utilized by equipment manufacturers based on a the size of the screen and monitor's weight.__Additional details can be found by ordering the specific FDMI mounting design specification directly from the VESA organization or going to their website at [www.vesa.org](http://www.vesa.org/)

In my day [VESA](http://www.vesa.org/) was just a [video standard](http://www.vesa.org/Standards/summaries.htm) and plasma & LCD TVs hadn't been invented yet !
