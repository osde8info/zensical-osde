[pidgintech](http://www.pidgintech.com/) have created [http://www.klostu.com/](http://www.klostu.com/) and [http://www.fotopages.com/](http://www.fotopages.com/) but can they compete with the awesomeness of VOX ?

and what is the connection (if any) between pidgintech and the free libre open source [pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/) IM client ?
