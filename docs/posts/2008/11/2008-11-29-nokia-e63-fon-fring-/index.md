Thanks to those nice people at WOM I've just been lent a NOKIA E63 to evaluate for a couple of weeks.

I first tried it with my nearest BT FON Wi-Fi hot spot discovering that FON now have a special .MOBI styled login page that makes it much easier for mobile users to login. Fring 3.36.15 also worked on the E63 now uses native NOKIA SIP services and still provides access to Skype, GoogleTalk & other VOIP and SIP services.

NOKIA have addressed a lot of the issues with the E61i now using a "standard" USB connector, "standard" 3.5mm audio connector and improved keyboard layout.

So now its an easy choice !

If I needed a mobile with GPS I'd buy a 6220c and if I needed WiFi,SIP,VOIP I'd buy a E63 !
