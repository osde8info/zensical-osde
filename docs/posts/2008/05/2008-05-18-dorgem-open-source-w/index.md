The [Dorgem](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dorgem/) Open Source Web Cam software project needs your [help](http://dorgem.sourceforge.net/helpwanted.html) if you know Direct X  & Direct Show.

[Dorgem](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dorgem/) _has unlimited storage events that can put the captured image on an FTP site as well as a local disk, all with their own time interval. It can put a unlimited texts and bitmaps on the captured image before the image is stored._

_Dorgem supports an unlimited number of simultaneous cameras. It has a built-in webserver for still images and can be used as security camera because of its motion detection._
