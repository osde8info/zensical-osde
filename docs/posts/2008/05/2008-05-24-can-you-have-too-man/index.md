I thought I was doing pretty well with ~1,700 [flickr contacts](http://www.flickr.com/people/osde-info/) but [Robyn T](http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/robynt/) has far surpassed me with her ~170,000 [mybloglog friends](http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/robynt/contacts/) ! OK so Robyn T works for Yahoo! but that's no excuse !
