[Unbound](http://unbound.net/index.html) is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver.

_The C implementation of Unbound is developed and maintained by [NLnet Labs](http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/). It is based on ideas and algorithms taken from a java prototype developed by [Verisign](http://www.verisign.com/) labs, [Nominet](http://www.nominet.org.uk/), [Kirei](http://www.kirei.se/) and [ep.net](http://www.ep.net/)._

_Unbound is designed as a set of modular components, so that also DNSSEC (secure DNS) validation and stub-resolvers (that do not run as a server, but are linked into an application) are easily possible._

_The source code is under a [BSD License](http://unbound.net/svn/trunk/LICENSE)._
