[Mahalo](http://www.mahalo.com/) is a dynamic Web 3.0 search engine which is a search community created by and for "Social Media Network" and "Business Media Network"s members.

You can start today by installing and using the [Mahalo Firefox AddOn](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6396) which you can even configure it to dual / triple / quad post to del.icio.us (and many other social bookmarking sites) at the same time for full future-proofing your efforts !

For example I've made my start @ :

- [http://www.mahalo.com/Virtualisation](http://www.mahalo.com/Virtualisation)
- [http://www.mahalo.com/Virtual\_Machine](http://www.mahalo.com/Virtual_Machine)
- [http://www.mahalo.com/Virtual\_Machines](http://www.mahalo.com/Virtual_Machines)
- [http://www.mahalo.com/Software\_Appliance](http://www.mahalo.com/Software_Appliance)
- [http://www.mahalo.com/Software\_Appliances](http://www.mahalo.com/Software_Appliances)  
    

  
PS Its currently in BETA and they could probably use some work on handling of singulars and plurals !
