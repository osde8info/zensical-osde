Technology can be scary - even if it's a bargain !

TESCO have been selling off Canon IXUS 70's (with free Canon Selphy printer) for £99 but now I know why ! It must be to make shelf space for the IXUS 80 @ £199 ! However I find the IXUS face detection focus square that hovers over your subjects face while you move the camera fairly scary although its probably just the same technology used 100,000's of times everyday on the CCTV cameras around LGW & LHR for vehicle number plate detection. Old hat maybe or maybe it's just been a long time since I last bought a digital camera !

In Argos the Panasonic SDR-S7EB-K @ £220 features "_3 second pre-record_" that starts recording 3 seconds "_before you press record_" surely this has to be the worlds cheapest time machine ! And the Panasonic SDR-SW20EB-R UNDERWATER camcorder for £280 ! Isn't that how much they use to sell the waterproof cases for !

Finally TkMax are selling £100 PHILIPS Baby Alarms for £40 that phone your mobile when your baby crys ! I can see two flaws in that 1) what are you going to do when you are 50/500/5000 miles away ? 2) you have to install a phone line in every room your baby might be in ! Maybe TkMax are clearing their shelfs for a Wi-Fi enabled, multi-sensor version with dial IN as well as dial OUT capabilities !

Now that I would buy for £40 !
