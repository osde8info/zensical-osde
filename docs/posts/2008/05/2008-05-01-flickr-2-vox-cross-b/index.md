### Do you have a (VOX) blog?

_If you do, you can [connect to it via Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/blogs.gne?from=extend). Why? So you can post photos or video you see around here straight to your blog. When you go through the process, you have to connect to your blogging service first (by telling us the URL and your username & password), then you can choose a layout for each post (or create your own if you know a bit of HTML)._
