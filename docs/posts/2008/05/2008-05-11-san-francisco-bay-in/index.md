[Hi-Def San Francisco](http://hd-sf.com/) are doing some amazing things with their San Francisco Bay webcam :

- [time lapse ships](http://hd-sf.com/gallery/sailboatcrazy/player.html) videos  
    
- real time [shipping map](http://hd-sf.com/livemap.html) that uses AIS data  
    
- panoramic panoramas [dawn](http://hd-sf.com/panoramics/dawnpano.html) [moon](http://hd-sf.com/panoramics/moonpano.html) [night](http://hd-sf.com/panoramics/nightpano.html)

How do these work ? It's as if they've turned a photo into a Google map and are using the Google map player to display it ? Can anyone do this ?
