[_isk-daemon_](http://server.imgseek.net/) is an [open source](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) standalone server and library _capable of adding content-based (visual) [image searching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBIR)_ _to any image related website._  

_This technology allows users of any image-related website or software to sketch on a widget which image they want to find and have the website reply to them the most similar images or simply request for more similar photos at each image detail page._

_Don’t forget to check out a [demo](http://fs.imgseek.net/) of this technology._
