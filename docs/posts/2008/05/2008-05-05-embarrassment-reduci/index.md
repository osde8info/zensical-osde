The latest [GoogleMail](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en-GB/about_whatsnew.html) feature is :

**Embarrassment reducing new message notifications**  "_Ever replied to a message only to find out that someone sent a better, smarter reply right before you? Now, if someone sends a reply while you're in the middle of reading a conversation (or replying to it), you'll get a notification that a new message has arrived. Click "update conversation" to see what you’ve missed._"

You see there are benefits in letting a third party such as Google have access to all your emails !
