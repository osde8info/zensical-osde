Why would Google [accept / approve / sponsor](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-project-google-summer-code-2008%21) Tor for the Google Summer of Code 2008 ?

[Tor](http://www.torproject.org/) is an organisation that "_helps you defend against [traffic analysis](http://www.torproject.org/overview.html.en), a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy_" ie by attempting to subvert all Web Analytics tools including Google Analytics and apparently [Tor](http://www.torproject.org/) also [breaks Google Search](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-project-google-summer-code-2008%21#comment-24) itself ! Surely Googles primary product ?
