[ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net/) have just introduced a new concept of open source software "stacks" which are collections of your favorite free libre open software grouped into functional collections for example for "desktop", "server", "PBX" etc.

You should be able to see the stacks I've created FSSE (server), OSDE (desktop) , VOIP & VIZZ (virtualisation)
