I use the [GNU diff utilities](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/diffutils) all the time but thanks to [ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net/) i've just discovered there are also plenty of graphical / visual comparison / difference tools & utilitys such as

- [jdiff](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/4798)
- [kdiff3](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/kdiff3) (2-way & 3-way diffs)  
    
- [kompare](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/kompare)  
    
- [meld](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/5747)  
    
- [tkdiff](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/12614)

and the very exciting sounding

- [svn-time-lapse-view](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/11525)

Which diff tool / utility do you use the most ?
