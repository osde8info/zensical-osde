How did I manage to miss the "VOX | Edit Profile | Contact Information | Your Accounts Elsewhere" other social media network accounts listing feature ? I've been using My Link instead / by mistake and wondering why i couldn't see the other SMN icons or add more that four other networks !

I've just sorted it out so now you can see links to my del.icio.us, flickr, pownce, last.fm, youtube, etc, etc accounts !

Make sure you change the default visibility of your other SMNs to "visible to : the world" (if thats what you want !)

How many users does it take before VOX add automatic icons to "other" SMNs such as [mybloglog](http://www.mybloglog.com/buzz/members/osde-info/), [nowpublic](http://members.nowpublic.com/osde_info), [virb](http://virb.com/backend/osde8info) ?
