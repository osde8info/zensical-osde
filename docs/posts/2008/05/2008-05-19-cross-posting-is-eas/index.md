Here's a good example why I don't blog on NING (apart from their comment wall spaming system). To blog a single story about about Ed/X/Ubuntu I'd have to **login / logout** to / from **each and every one** of these NING networks/groups separately **then** cut & paste the same story **nine times** to each of these NING networks/groups !

Sorry NING but I would like some spare time to a have a first life !

Whoever created VOX **single/two click** cross network/group posting is a **genius** ! It's only taken me twelve clicks to cross post this to six VOX networks/groups !
