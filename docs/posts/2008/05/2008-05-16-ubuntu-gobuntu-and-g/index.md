_The new "Free software only" installation option in the normal Ubuntu (press F6 in the boot menu twice) basically achieves what Gobuntu is aiming for, as long as the general goal of having "clean" main and universe repositories is fulfilled (which is goal of the Ubuntu as a whole)._

_Given that many goals Gobuntu has are goals of Ubuntu in general also, and the fact that [![[WWW]](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/htdocs/ubuntu/img/u-www.png) gNewSense](http://www.gnewsense.org/) is anyway doing the work that can also benefit Ubuntu (knowledge of problematic packages), the mission of Gobuntu is a bit up in the air._

```
The "current and future" thread on this list has got me thinking. Perhaps we really are on the wrong track, that the only way to meet the needs of the gNewSense folks is to have completely different source packages to Ubuntu. If that is the case, then I think it would be better to channel the energy from Gobuntu into gNewSense.
