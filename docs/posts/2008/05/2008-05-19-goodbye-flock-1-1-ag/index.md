I've been giving you ([flock 1.1](http://flock.com/)) a chance every six months for the last few years and this latest time you did last a **record** 24 hours BUT although you work fine on my work Dual Core 2G work desktop my notebook at home is a lowly Pentium 1G which **hates running continuously** at between **88% - 99%** **CPU** so its back to trusty old [firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) i'm afraid.

I might take another look in another six months time ? (When you @ 1.4 ?)
