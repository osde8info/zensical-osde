BUT why doesn't NING provide a link listing them and the other 200 NING social media networks I'm a member of ?  
Why dont they want you to know about them ALL ? A network is just an island unless its linked isn't it ? In an attempt to rectify this situation I'm now going to try and post pictures of all the SECRET social media network list URLs that NING dont want you to know about !
