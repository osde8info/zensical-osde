Note that as part of taking Ubuntu Delivered by rPath beyond its current alpha status, we have been making changes to our infrastructure to better support this platform. Because of the nature of these changes, updates to existing appliances based on Ubuntu Delivered by rPath will fail and need to be rebuilt and redeployed.
