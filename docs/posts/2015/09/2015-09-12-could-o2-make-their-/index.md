big-bundles _last for one month and renew automatically on the same day each month - but only if you've got enough credit to cover the payment. If you don't, choose when you want to top up again and you'll get your bundle when you do._

with #big-bundle (basic) your credit expires every month so after 6 months your balance will be £0 but with #big-talker and #international your o2 sms allowance expires every month but you get to keep your credit and after 6 months your balance will be £60

there is also no difference between #big-talker and #international except that on #international you can make calls to some countrys for 1p min so what is the point in #big-talker
