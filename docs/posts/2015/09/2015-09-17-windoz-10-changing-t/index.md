m$ have changed the control panel(s) in windows 10 for clock, languages and region so you now need to

- download English (United Kingdom) Language Pack - Windows 10
- reboot
- choose UK instead of US in about 6 different places
- reset default locale to UK
- copy UK locale to system locale and the new user locale
