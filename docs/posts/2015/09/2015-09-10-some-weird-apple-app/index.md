some wierd apple icloud itunes features for families and groups

you can now share apps with others and buy a monthy recurring gift card for others

http://www.apple.com/sg/icloud/family-sharing/

it would probably be much easier if you could transfer an app store purchase to another account BUT APPLE WONT LET YOU DO THAT SO THAT WHEN YOU DIE YOUR APPS DIE WITH YOU
