Just been blown away by youtube's automatic copyright detection of a eurthymics track being played in the background of a video i made inside the @beberlin @visitberlin oneperson #disco #phonebooth.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb58vmz\_2hc

YouTube bizarely says you cant make money from the video but

- You can use the copyrighted content in your video, but ads might appear on your video.
- Your video can't be played in these countries: Germany

So maybe @beberlin @visitberlin should remove eurthymics track and any other tracks banned in germany from #their #disco #phoneboothshould so they can actually watch the video back home
