the [giffgaff](https://www.giffgaff.com/orders/affiliate/osde8info) #mobile network cleverly lets you move your monthly payg (!) contract forward if you run out of data @giffgaff **but** you stupidly only get a 5 minute 5 MB **window** to do this in **OR** you need access to a PC connected to the internet !

time to look at 100% free freedompop mobile instead

_To avoid using your [giffgaff](https://www.giffgaff.com/orders/affiliate/osde8info) credit when you run out of goodybag minutes/texts/MB, you can now bring forward a goodybag with early repurchase (if you have less than 5 mins or 5MB left)._
