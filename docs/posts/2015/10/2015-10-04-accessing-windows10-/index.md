In windows 10 your uefi bios settings are no longer accessed via ESC,F1, F2, F10 or F12 instead you need to boot into windows 10 first then click

- windows start (yes its back ! yay!)
- settings
- update & security
- recovery
- advanced start up | restart now
- troubleshoot
- advanced options
- uefi firmware settings
- restart

once you have done all this you should see the UEFI BIOS screen you used to get when pressing F1 etc
