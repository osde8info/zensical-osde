did you know there are two amazon apps for your android ? confusingly they have the same icon

you can get the amazon amazon app from https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000479543&forceHttps=0&ref\_=aa\_mshop\_aap\_anp\_uk

but you will have to play with your security settingsto install it

or you can get the android play amazon app from google play

the advantage of the amazon amazon app is that you can get a free app a day from the amazon app store which is only built in to this version
