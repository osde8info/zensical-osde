welcome to [@lphabetise](https://twitter.com/lphabetise)® [#smn](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23smn) [#bmn](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bmn) [#smnm](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23smnm) [#bmnm](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bmnm) born from a worldwide shortage of 3-6 character [@twitter](https://twitter.com/twitter) handles and [#domain](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23domain) names

its 2am and just woke up with a great idea why not create a web presence based off some word beginning with A and ending with R so i can use @myword® as a brandname

for example lets try @ffai®.com, @rmou®.com or even @utho®.com

but the concept quickly falls apart since there seem to be no 3, 4,  5 or 6 character twitter handles available with corresponding domain name left in the world and after 2 hours intensive searching and $20 later the closest we can get is [@lphabetise](https://twitter.com/lphabetise)®

PS the effect is better in some fonts than others
