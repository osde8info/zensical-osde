apple ios 9.1 and 9.2 updates can break iphone wifi personal hotspot because the iphone wifi immediately connects to any pre-existing wifi hotspots thus blocking your iphone 3G/4G mobile hotspot

workarounds

- goto a location (ie a forest) where there are no other wifi hotspots
- tether very very quickly before iphone gets a chance to connect to other wifi hotspots
- disable every other wifi hotspot on your iphone as they connect and you may finally be able to tether your other device
