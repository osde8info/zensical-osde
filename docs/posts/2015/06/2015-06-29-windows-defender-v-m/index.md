_**Windows Defender on XP/Vista/7** detects and removes known **spyware** only. It is not designed to protect against the full breadth of malicious software, and specifically does not prevent viruses, worms, Trojans, and other malicious software from infecting your machine._

_**Microsoft Security Essentials** should disable Windows Defender on Vista and Windows 7 and uninstall it from XP. In some cases, this does not happen automatically._

_**Microsoft Security Essentials** is designed to disable Windows Defender in order to manage the PC’s real-time protection, including **anti-virus**, rootkits, Trojans and spyware._

_**Windows Defender on Windows 8** is more like MSE than like Windows Defender on older versions of Windows._
