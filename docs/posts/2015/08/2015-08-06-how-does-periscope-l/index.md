had my first experience of periscope https://www.periscope.tv/about this evening as i watched someone periscoping this evenings @skillsmatter #codenode #devops talk so decided to periscope them ! but where are the links to the videos ? can i only watch them via the app ? how long will they be kept before they are deleted ? why do hearts appear on the screen when i move my finger ?

also just had a random popup about a group periscoping from a pub in ireland !
