it shouldn't take over 2 hrs to setup a whitelabel webcam but it did because

- it only worked with WiFi WPA2 AES passwords
- it only allows admin passwords of a specific length despite letting you enter more characters
- it only allows admin passwords of alphanumeric characters despite letting you enter any character
- technicolor adsl modem cached firewall rules so you have to delete and recreate instead of simply editing

next time i should read the small print and pay more than $1 wholesale (£40 retail)
