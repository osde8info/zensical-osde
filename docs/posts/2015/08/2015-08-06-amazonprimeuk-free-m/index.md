@amazonprimeuk FREE mp3s are NOT FREE if you click "**Buy now option**" OR "**Add to MP3 basket**" instead of "**Listen with Prime music and add to library**" so if you have been ripped off DO NOT play or download the MP3s and email amazon suppport immediately and ask for a refund

Here is what they said

_The reason you were charged is that you might have selected  "**Buy now option**" on website instead of selecting "**Listen with Prime music and add to library**"._

_Further, I request you to kindly go to website and access these albums by clicking on "Listen with Prime music and add to library" and you will be able to get them via Prime music free of charge._

_The only reason why you were charged is the you might have selected "Buy now option" on website instead of selecting "Listen with Prime music and add to library"._

Im sorry @amazonuk but to me there IS NOT A BIG difference between the phrases "**Add to MP3 basket**" and "**Listen with Prime music and add to library**" and IT IS NOT obvious you will be charged **£5** if you click the wrong one
