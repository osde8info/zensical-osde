when its google chorme !

not only is google chrome the gui for an os (google chromium) google chrome "browser" also acts as a print server and you will need the google chrome "browser" installed but not necessarily open on a windoz pc if you want to print to a non eprint printer from a google chrome book !

google chrome books sends non eprint jobs to the google chrome browser/server running on your windoz pc so you'll also need to leave your pc turned on and logged in if you want to be able to print from your chromebook !
