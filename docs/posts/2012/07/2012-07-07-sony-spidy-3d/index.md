[The Amazing Spider-Man 3D 2012](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0948470/ "spiderman")  from SONY Pictures is simply the best film i've seen in 10 years and the best 3D film i've seen ever ! (however to be fair i've not seen very many in that time)

Loved:

- the SONY unbranding of the Pentax SLR camera
- the SONY product placement of SONY VAIO notebooks
- the SONY product placement of SONY XPERIA android mobiles
- the screenplay
- the 3D effects
- New York
- the comedy

Not sure about:

- one corny line from auntie at the end
- Gwen being 17 - according to IMDB [Emma Stone](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1297015/ "emma stone") is already 24

Go see it ! And go see it again if you didn't see it in 3D the first time ! Then go see it in IMAX 3D !
