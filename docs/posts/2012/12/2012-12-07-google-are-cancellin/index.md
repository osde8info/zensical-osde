google are cancelling FREE goog apps for SMBs and SMEs

http://googleenterprise.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/changes-to-google-apps-for-businesses.html

_With this in mind, we’ve decided to make things very straightforward._

_Starting today for all new customers:_

_Individuals wishing to use Google’s web apps like Gmail and Google Drive should create a free personal Google Account, which provides a seamless experience across all of our web services on any device._

_For Businesses, instead of two versions, there will be one. Companies of all sizes will sign up for our premium version, Google Apps for Business, which includes 24/7 phone support for any issue, a 25GB inbox, and a 99.9% uptime guarantee with no scheduled downtime. Pricing is still $50 per user, per year._

_Please note this change has no impact on our existing customers, including those using the free version. And as before, Google Apps for Education will be available as a free service for schools and universities._
