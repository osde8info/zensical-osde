The FBI have discovered that _DNSChanger's malicious DNS servers were being used to automatically and involuntarily convert the DNS settings of millions of people around the world, then using that control to redirect valid URLs to malicious sites._

_The FBI took over the servers, but realized fast they couldn't simply shut them down. To do that would immediately take all infected Internet users offline, as without DNS it's as though the Internet doesn't work._

The FBI and other invested groups _have campaigned for the remaining estimated 350,000 infected people to switch their DNS proactively to a secure service which infected users will now HAVE to do before 9 Jul 12 !_
