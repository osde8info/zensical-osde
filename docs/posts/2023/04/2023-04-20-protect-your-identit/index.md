protect your identity by switching from the default #android #mobile camera app to the @opencamera app #photography #geotagging #gps

the default android camera app saves your location with your photos (it also broken on nexus 7 androids)

opencamera for android puts a button on your view screen that lets you turn #geotagiing #gps on and off

opencamera for android also has a realtime autolevel feature not just a crossbar
