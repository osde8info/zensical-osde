can exposed unwanted info to all twitter users

just so it doesnt happen to you

DO NOT USE ALT-PRTSCREEN in a RDP session it actually does a FULLSCREEN dump

which in this case included a second open edge window listing personal data

which i pasted into WP 

which was auto posted to TWITTER

which autogenerated a thumbnail

which did NOT get updated when i replaced img in WP

SO make sure you USE edge web capture INSTEAD of ALT-PRTSCN when using tweeting over RDP 

FINALLY fixed now at [https://twitter.com/osde8info/status/1611415211897929752](https://twitter.com/osde8info/status/1611415211897929752)
