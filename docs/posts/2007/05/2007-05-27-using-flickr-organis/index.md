I know the "flickr organiser" has been around for a long time but I only used it for the first time today ! As part of my Bank Holiday Monday project I decided to tag, geotag and regroup some of my photos !

I  was amazed how easy it was to use ! Just goto [http://www.flickr.com/photos/organize/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/organize/) and filter out your photos at the bottom of the page, then drag them to the middle of the page then you can tag that "batch" with the same tag or even same geo location !

For example I found 4 of my WTC photos added them to some NY flickr groups and geotagged them all to NY,NY,USA in just a few drag drops and clicks !  
I'm not even using a powerful PC (just an old IBM PIII with 256M running GnewSense and RunningDog !)
