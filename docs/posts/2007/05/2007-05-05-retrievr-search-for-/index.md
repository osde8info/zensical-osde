[retrievr](http://labs.systemone.at/retrievr/) is an experimental service which lets you search and explore in a selection of [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) images by drawing a rough sketch.

  

Currently the index contains many of Flickr's [most interesting](http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/) images.
