**PUBLICISING**  
Check you account status

If your account is also flagged as "**NIPSA**", you may be one of the people caught up in the transition between the old system of moderation (public, pending, private accounts etc) and the new way (safety level/content type filters). It's fairly likely that if your account is NIPSA, it's because your account was NIPSA pre-transition, and that it may require a review by staff.

You can [request a review](http://flickr.com/help/contact/?cat_shortcut=review_account) if you wish.
