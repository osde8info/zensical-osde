**The Online Staff Holiday Planner**

[http://www.whosoff.com/](http://www.whosoff.com/)  
Having visited hundreds of companies, only to find HR, Administrators, company owners, and managers ALL, wrestling with the same age-old problem of who can take holiday when and, in the main, asking themselves Who’s Off? … we felt it was time to deliver a FREE and simple to use service online.

WhosOff.com makes easy work of staff holiday planning applying restrictions between staff where applicable, application followed by approval by manager and a transparent view to all those involved within the organisation online anywhere.
