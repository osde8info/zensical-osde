Here are a few things a blogaholic could do this Bank Holiday Monday (if it's still raining) !

- Start clearing your blog mountain backlog (see below)
- Geotag any untagged flickr photos
- Upgrade any WordPress sites to WordPress 2.2
- Leave some social networks/groups that you aren't very active on  
    
- Join some new social networks/groups ([NING](http://www.ning.com/), [nowpublic](http://www.nowpublic.com/), VOX or [XING](https://www.xing.com/))
