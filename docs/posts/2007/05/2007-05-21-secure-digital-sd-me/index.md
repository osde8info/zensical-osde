Are you confused about secure digital SD memory cards speeds ? As far as I can tell

Type : Speed : X

  
  
  
  
  

| I = 6MB = 40X    |
| --- |
| II = 12MB = 80X    |
| III = 20MB = 133X    |
| IV = 40MB = 266X    |

You can buy SD cards from ByteStor, Crucial, Kingston, Lexar but make sure you check the speed first if you need a particular speed such as 10MB (as my digital camera does) !
