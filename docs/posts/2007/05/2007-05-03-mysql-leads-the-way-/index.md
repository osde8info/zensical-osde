The Quality Contribution Program goal is to improve the quality of MySQL products, with the active co-operation of the MySQL user community.

The program facilitates this by  
   1. visibly acknowledging the participants by attributing individual quality enhancements to them;  
   2. rewarding the participants with benefits in proportion to their contribution (Awards are subscriptions to MySQL Enterprise);  
   3. streamlining the process of contributing to MySQL Quality for the benefit of both current and future contributors

Quality Contributions fall into three categories: (i) bug reports, (ii) test cases, and (iii) code patches. We evaluate each contribution with a publicly verifiable set of rules, and the contributor accumulates the QA points for all contributions submitted during the last 12 months.
