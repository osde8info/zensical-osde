It's coming! 24 Hours of Flickr: A global Flickr community event

What happens around the world in one day? In a word – life. Here on Flickr, our members are sharing the world that they see: snapping daily moments, recording history, telling stories, capturing beauty.

To celebrate this global community, we invite you to join us in _24 Hours of Flickr_, a day-long global photo project. On May 5 2007, grab your camera and whatever else you need, and chronicle your day in pictures.
