[MyTelegraph](http://my.telegraph.co.uk/) allows users to create their own blogs, profiles, write their own blog posts, and personalise their blog pages.

[http://www.travelmail.co.uk/home/home.html](http://www.travelmail.co.uk/home/home.html) is an opportunity for you to share your holiday experiences with other Travelmail users. Whether you had a great time or a terrible time abroad you can tell the world about it and encourage others to go (or possibly stay away). You can also add pictures and videos to your submission. Pictures and Videos bring colour to your pages and help other people understand your experience better.
