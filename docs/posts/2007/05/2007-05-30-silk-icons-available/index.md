“Silk” is a smooth, [free icon set](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/), containing over **700** 16-by-16 pixel icons in strokably-soft PNG format. Containing a large variety of icons, you're sure to find something that tickles your fancy.

All I ask is that you include a link back to this page in your credits (although a giant link on every page of your website really isn't needed, contact me to discuss specifics).
