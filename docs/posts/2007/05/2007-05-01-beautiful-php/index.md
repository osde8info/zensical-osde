Now you don't need coding standards to create beautiful PHP since PHP PEAR even has a [http://pear.php.net/package/PHP\_Beautifier](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_Beautifier) !

Just check out their [before](http://beautifyphp.sourceforge.net/example.phps) and [after](http://beautifyphp.sourceforge.net/example_output.phps) beautification links !

Who said open source projects didn't have documentation  
[http://beautifyphp.sourceforge.net/docs/](http://beautifyphp.sourceforge.net/docs/)
