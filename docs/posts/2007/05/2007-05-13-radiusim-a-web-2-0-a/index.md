The [radiusIM](http://www.radiusim.com/) registration screen is seriously broken if you are using Firefox on Ubuntu !

_**What is radiusIM?**_  
radiusIM is Social IM. It’s the only website that shows you where your friends are hanging out and lets you surf for other people based on location. It supports all the major networks: MSN, AIM/ICQ, Yahoo, and GTalk/Jabber. And you can use radiusIM from anywhere because there are no downloads.
