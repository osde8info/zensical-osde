[Ning](http://www.ning.com/) was founded in October 2004 to give everyone the opportunity to create social networks.

When we started, we wanted to enable a diversity of social networks the same way the web browser enabled millions of different websites. Two years later, Ning powers over 46,000 social networks and counting.  

[Ning is a platform](http://blog.ning.com/2007/02/what_is_a_platform.html) for creating your own social networks. Our passion is putting new social networks in the hands of anyone with a good idea. With Ning, your social network can be anything and anyone you want it to be.

You choose a combination of features (videos, blogs, photos, forums, etc.) from an ever growing list of options, you choose how it looks, you decide if it is public or private, you add your brand if you have one, and you enable the people on your network to create their own custom personal profile pages all in one great social network.
