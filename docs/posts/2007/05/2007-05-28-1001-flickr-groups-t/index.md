This rainy Bank Holiday Monday was the perfect excuse to spend all day blogging and as a result [I really am](http://www.flickr.com/photos/fsse-info/) a genuine member of [1001 flickr groups](http://www.flickr.com/groups/1001/) !

Is anyone else a member of 1001 (flickr, upcoming, ning, vox, xing, nowpublic) social network groups ?

PS The main downside is that it makes all your AJAX drop down lists very slow to load !
