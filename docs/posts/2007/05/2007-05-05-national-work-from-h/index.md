Work Wise Week (May 16 to 22) will consist of a series of events starting with the Work Wise Annual Summit (Wednesday May 16), and including National Work From Home Day (Friday May 18) and Work Wise Weekend (May 19 and 20).

Work Wise Week in 2006, including National Work from Home Day, was a huge success, prompting over 85 television and radio interviews, and upwards of 500 articles and news stories.  

  
This year media interest is expected to be even stronger.
