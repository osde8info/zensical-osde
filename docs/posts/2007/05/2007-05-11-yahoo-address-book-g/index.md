To take advantage of new technologies, we've recently changed the way we store information in your Yahoo! Address Book. These changes will make it much easier for you to add and edit contacts.  

However, it also may affect how the current information in your Address Book looks. In some cases, it may even make contact information completely illegible.

Is anyone else having problems with the "[Yahoo! Encoding Wizard](http://help.yahoo.com/help/uk/ab/ab-39.html)" not actually doing anything ?
