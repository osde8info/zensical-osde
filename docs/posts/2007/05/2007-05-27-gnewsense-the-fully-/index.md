[gNewSense](http://www.gnewsense.org/Main/Features) is derived from Ubuntu, and thus has most of the same functionality.  

There are a number of differences though.

- Firmware removed from kernel in main\*
- [Builder](http://www.gnewsense.org/Builder/Builder), a tool to produce a distribution
- Restricted removed
- Ubuntu logos replaced
- Universe enabled by default
- emacs, bsdgames, nethack and build-essential part of the default install

Note the goal is to produce a fully free distribution, not to have as many features as possible.
