[**Pearl Crescent Page Saver**](http://pearlcrescent.com/products/pagesaver/) is an extension for [Mozilla Firefox](http://getfirefox.com/) that lets you capture images of web pages even if the page design is bigger than your screen. These images can be saved in PNG format or (with Firefox 2) in JPEG format.
