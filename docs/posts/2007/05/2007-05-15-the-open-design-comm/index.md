[**The Open Design Community**](http://opendesigns.org/) (TODC) is a group of **Open Source Website Designers** providing **free-of-charge web design templates** helping to make the global internet a prettier place.

Apparently there is a [Hobo](http://hobocentral.net/) demo showing how TODC templates can be used ! _Hobo is currently in early beta - version 0.5.3. Although Hobo is in active use in production applications, please be aware that if you choose to deploy a Hobo/Rails application on the Internet you do so at your own risk_
