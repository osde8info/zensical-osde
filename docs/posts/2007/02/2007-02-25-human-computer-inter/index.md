[Tantek](http://tantek.com/log/2007/02.html#d19t1813) suggests you :

- Minimize the number of text fields in your interfaces down to the absolute minimum necessary.
- Minimize the number of click/keystrokes/gestures necessary to accomplish actions in your interface.
- Make your interface as responsive as possible.  
    
- Minimize the latency of each and every action a user might take in your interface.
