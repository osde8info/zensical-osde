There is a problem has been bugging me for some time now and that is the problem of worldwide blogs and language. For example if my preferred language is French I'll probably blog in French but how can I approve feedback and comments from people who have a different preferred language ?

Is there an unwritten etiquette that dictates you only post comments in the same language as the original post ? Should the "approver" use bablefish to translate comments into their preferred language before approving them? and then only approve and repost the babelfish output ?

How does a "global" ISP or blog site like VOX make sure that all posts in all languages are not offensive or abusive without employing enough people to know every language in the world ? If anyone from VOX is reading please let me know your solutions !

NOTE : I'm sorry but I feel I can only approve comments in English until I have solved this dilemma !
