There are great sites for [Open Clip Art](http://www.openclipart.org/) and [Open Fonts](http://www.openfontlibrary.org/) you could even create your own font using [Font Forge](http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/). Thanks to [LinuxUser](http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/) for bringing my attention to these opensource sites.
