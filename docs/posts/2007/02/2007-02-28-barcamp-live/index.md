# What is BarCamp ?  

  
A [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/BarCamp) is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants but make sure you have read [The Rules Of Bar Camp](http://barcamp.org/TheRulesOfBarCamp) first !

There is even a [Bar Camp News Visual Aggregator.](http://barcamp.org/BarCampNewsVisualAggregator)
