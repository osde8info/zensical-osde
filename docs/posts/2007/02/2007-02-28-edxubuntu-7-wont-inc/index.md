In this months [LinuxUser](http://linuxuser.co.uk/) Jono Bacon says that "...it was decided that Compiz and Beryl aren't mature enough..." for 3D hardware accelerated graphics drivers to be included by default.

If you want a \*buntu distro that will always be 100% free-libre-open and never have any binary graphics drivers then you could try [GnewSense](http://www.gnewsense.org/).
