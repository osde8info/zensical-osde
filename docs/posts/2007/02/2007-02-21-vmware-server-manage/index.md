VMware Server MUI is a web based system monitor runs on port 8222 or 8333 and lets you start, stop and see CPU utilisation of your VMs. It is a completely optional component and you can just use VMware Server Console if you prefer.  
  
Even though VMware is free-of-charge it is not an opensource virtualiser like [XenSource](http://www.xensource.com/)
