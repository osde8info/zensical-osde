Just been told about the [http://www.cpaglobal.com/](http://www.cpaglobal.com/) website which has an animated favicon !

What's really clever (annoying) is that still animates when the site has been added to your bookmark toolbar !

However it only seems to animate when you are using Firefox (not that I'd use anything else)
