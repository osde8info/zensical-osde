Because Debian 4.0 isn't perfect (yet) there is still a place for Ed/X/Ubuntu !

Imperfections :  

- text based installer only optional (ideal for low spec machines like xubuntu-alt)  
    
- my third install (in 48 hours) has failed with a big red screen because it couldn't "autodetect" a printer
- using aptitude to uninstall either fast-user-switch or gdm insists on uninstalling the entire gnome desktop and most gnome apps !
- vmware mouse doesn't leave debian guest window unless you are running vmware-toolbox  
    

Debian has huge potential with over 18,000 packages on its 3 DVDs (basic install only uses ~800) and there is some great documentation out there :

and with everyones help we could make Debian No 1 again !

As an alternative, Debian 4.0 has included a nice graphical installer.  
  
To install with the graphical installer, when you first boot up with Debian install disc, type  
  
`installgui`  
  
at the first command prompt.
