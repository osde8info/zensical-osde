[Google Voice Local Search](http://labs.google.com/goog411/) is Google Labs experimental service to make local-business search accessible over the phone.

  

To try this service, just dial 1-800-GOOG-411 (1-800-466-4411) from any phone.

  

Using this service, you can:

- search for a local business by name or category.  
    You can say "Giovanni's Pizzeria" or just "pizza".  
      
    
- get connected to the business, free of charge.  
      
    
- get the details by SMS if you’re using a mobile phone.  
    Just say "text message".
