EDIMAX EW-7108PCG Wi-Fi cardbus card seems to be available in two colours ! "light red" and "dark red" !

It seems that the "light red" ones work with Ed/X/Ubuntu GnewSense GNU/Linux and "dark red" ones don't work ! To avoid confusion here are some photos of the "dark red" one : front of card, back of card and box it was in !
