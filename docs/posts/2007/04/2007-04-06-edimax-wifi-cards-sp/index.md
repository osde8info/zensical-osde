Q: What's the difference between [EDIMAX EW-7108PCG](http://osde-info.vox.com/library/post/edimax-ew-7108pcg-wi-fi-cardbus-card-in-light-red.html) and a [EDIMAX EW-7108PCG](http://osde-info.vox.com/library/post/edimax-ew-7108pcg-wi-fi-cardbus-card-in-dark-red.html) apart from the colour ?

A: The light red one works (on EdX/Ubuntu GNU/Linux) and the dark red one DOESN'T !

Another clue that I should have spotted is that the FCC ID numbers are different !

Morals:

If your Ed/X/Ubuntu GNU/Linux PC hangs EVERYTIME you boot it you have probably put a "dark red"  
card in by mistake !

And NEVER believe anyone that says a particular Wi-Fi card works under GNU/Linux I've also had the same experience with NETGEAR PCI Wi-Fi cards with the same part number where v2 works and v3 doesn't and a single BELKIN PCI Wi-Fi card that sometimes appear as two devices which I wouldn't mind if it were'nt that  neither worked !

A Wi-Fi card works ONLY if it works and has little to do with it's part number !
