Because  

- my docking station DVD is dead
- see that floppy and non-floppy BIOS updates  are available
- BOTH are .EXEs
- download BIOS updates
- one is bigger than 1.4M so it won't fit on a floppy !  
    
- build W2K VM  
    
- download floppy .EXE
- discover it's an OS-2 .EXE !!!
- built a W98 HD on a IBM ThinkPad T20
- swapped HDs (using screwdriver)  
    
- W98 didn't recognise network card and asked to insert W98 CD  
    
- swapped HDs
- added W98 directory from CD
- swapped HDs
- W98 still didn't reconise network card
- plugged in external USB DVD
- asked to insert driver CD
- \[i don't have a working CD which is why I am using USB DVD\] 
- swapped HDs
- build W2K HD (including copies of W2K CD and USB DVD CD)
- onboard network still not dected !
- insert 3COM PCMCIA network card  
    
- install 3COM driveres  
    
- download non-floppy BIOS updates onto HD
- swapped HDs

  

- swapped HDs
