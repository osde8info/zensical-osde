Now there are three open source directories that you can contribute to  

- [swik](http://swik.net/)
- [osalt](http://www.osalt.com/)
- [ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net/)

ohloh has three particularly interesting features  

- a related tag(s) auto suggestion that **has to seen/used** to be believed  
    
- show the world your [open source stack](http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/3283)  
    
- ohloh javascript badges !  
    

  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
How big is your **open source stack** ? I've only a member for 12 hours and [mine](http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/3283) is already 10 pages long
