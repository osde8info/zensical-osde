This month a Fonero can refer three friends to get a FON for €/$ 20

There are three kinds of [Fonero](https://www.fon.com/en/info/milkWifi):

- **Aliens** are people who don’t share their WiFi yet and are charged €/$ 3 for a Day Pass to access the FON Community.
- **Bills** are Foneros who, instead of free roaming, get to make money from their FON Access Point.
- **Linus**es share their WiFi at home and in return get free WiFi wherever they find a FON Access Point.
