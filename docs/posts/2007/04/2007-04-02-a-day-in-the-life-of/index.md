This weekend I set out to rebuild Xen server as an Edubuntu & VMware Server and install rPath SugarCRM, Joomla, AsteriskNOW, Tomcat  & W2K virtual machines. I also needed to install Xubuntu on a couple of IBM ThinkPads.

Installed Edubuntu and discovered that 119M is being used by SchoolTools so put remove instructions on Ubuntu wiki (BLOG#1), discover SchoolTools is missing from Ubuntu wiki (BLOG#2A) and Swik (BLOG#2B).

Fiddle with VMware services then get strange error when trying to start a virtual machine ! Remember I forgot to turn them back on so update VMware forum (BLOG#3).

Download rPath AsteriskNOW and Joomla software appliances. Joomla startup screen up has some great MySql security and MySql benchmarking tips so update fsse.info (BLOG#4) and cross ref back to VOX (BLOG#5). Take some AsteriskNOW screenshots and post to VOX (BLOG#5) and cross ref to voippix.org (BLOG#6)

OpenSolaris fails to boot after moving 2.5" HD from a PIII 256M IBM Thinkpad to one with only 128M. Error message says something about check "$ svcs -xv" ! Maybe that's the Solaris equivalent of Red Hat "$ services" better remember that (BLOG#7)

Decide to replace OpenSolaris with Xubuntu Alternative 6.06.01 which does work on 128M, so download ISO. Forgetton how to burn CDs on Ubuntu so "$ aptitude search burn". What's this "cpuburn" thing ? It sounds like it could be useful in the future ! (BLOG#8)

Read my del.icio.us network RSS feed ! What's this teachers.yahoo.com thing ? (BLOG#9), is there a VOX Teachers group ? Yes ! Join it ! Cross ref Yahoo Teachers to VOX Teachers (BLOG#10)

\[The never ending chain of semantic links seems to be infinite\]

Education hmmm ! Teachers would like Kalcium wouldn't they ? Kalcium isn't on Swik ! (BLOG#11A), cross ref to VOX (BLOG#11B). Actually Kalcium is also great edutainment ! Is there a VOX Edutainment group ? There is now (BLOG#11C).

\[I still maintain that groups == tags\]

Xubuntu Alt is now burn't so it's time to attack those two IBM ThinkPads. The IBM BIOS seems to be out of date ! But oh no the BIOS updater is an EXE (at least it's an EXE that creates floppies) ! Can I use WINE (which I've never tried) or do I need to build a W2K virtual machine from scratch (last done over four years ago)

Decide to go the known route and build W2K and then flash the BIOS ([BLOG#12](http://osde-info.vox.com/library/post/why-an-ibm-thinkpad-x20-bios-update-took-me-five-days.html)) but I'll blog the process so I'll remember in another four years ([BLOG#13](http://osde-info.vox.com/library/post/w2k-installation-process.html)). There must be some other valid excuses to use W2K ? I can only think of four ! ([BLOG#14](http://osde-info.vox.com/library/post/top-10-reasons-excuses-to-use-w2k.html))

See a del.icio.us link about another user saving £1000's by using Amazon EC2 thats worth a blog ([BLOG#15](http://osde-info.vox.com/library/post/amazon-compute-cloud-ec2-amazon-machine-image-ami.html)) and maybe a VOX group (BLOG#16)

FINALLY blog this (BLOG#17)

Not bad for a weekends work ! I need a break now !
