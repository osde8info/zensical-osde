I just installed the new del.icio.us firefox addon

1. It KILLED performance of my PC because it "syncs" my 3000 online bookmarks with the local PC
2. I can't see suggested tags any more since it displays a list of 200 of my network contacts first  
    
3. ... I was just about to uninstall it when ...  
    
4. It freaked me out by displaying bookmarks (that i created at work yesterday) on the new del.icio.us toolbar of my home PC

For an instant I thought I was in my office at 6am on Saturday morning !

So BEWARE I expect it will display your home bookmarks on your work PC if you install the new del.icio.us on your work PC !
