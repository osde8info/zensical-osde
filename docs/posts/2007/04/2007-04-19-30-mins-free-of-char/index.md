It really couldn’t be simpler, power up the laptop, order your drink or food from the bar and ask for a Wi-Fi voucher; this contains an access code for your computer. You will then connect to a network free for 30 minutes – order another drink and go on line for another 30 minutes @ [Wetherspoons](http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/magazine/viewarticle.php?ID=23)
