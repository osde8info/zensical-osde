[http://www.idtprime.com/](http://www.idtprime.com/) are offering to sell you (if you are over 18) a prepaid Prime Card mastercard for a £3 fee:

**"  
****Buying your Prime Card couldn't be simpler, no bank accounts, no credit checks, no fuss.**

**It's ready to use wherever you see the Mastercard acceptance mark - over 24 million locations worldwide.**

**Use it online or enjoy the security and convenience of being cash free in shops, cinemas and restaurants across the UK and abroad.  
  
No age restrictions on use.**

**FOR EVERYONE, INSTANTLY  
"  
**  
What I'm not clear about how you prevent these prepaid credit cards getting into the hands of minors of anyone else under the age of 18 ! I thought a number of web sites were using credit cards as PROOF OF AGE ?
