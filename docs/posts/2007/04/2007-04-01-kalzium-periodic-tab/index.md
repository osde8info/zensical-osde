[Kalzium](http://edu.kde.org/kalzium/) is an application which will show you some information about the periodic system of the elements. Therefore you could use it as an information database.

Kalzium has already some nice features but there are still a lot of things to do. As Kalzium has been included in KDE 3.1 we are currently coding quite lot to bring in some new and nice features and make it as fast and usefull as possible. You can help us by testing it or make proposals for new features or a better design.
