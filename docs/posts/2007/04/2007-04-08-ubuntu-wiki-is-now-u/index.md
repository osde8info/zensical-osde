#### [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WikiLicensing](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WikiLicensing)  

#### Choice of License

- It was originally planned to put material on the wiki into the public domain. However, after extremely wide consultation with the community on this issue, many users objected that they would be unhappy with material contributed by them being used in non-free derivative works. As a result it seems clear that a free sharealike license should be used.
    
- The [![[WWW]](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/htdocs/ubuntu/img/u-www.png) CC-By-SA license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) is a good choice, for many reasons:
    
    - It is used by the system documentation,
        
    - It is used by the Ubuntu forums,
        
    - It is used by the Official Ubuntu Book,
        
    - It is a popular and well known license.
