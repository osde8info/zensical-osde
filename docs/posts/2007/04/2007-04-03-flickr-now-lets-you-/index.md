#### When you upload photos you can now click advanced options which lets you choose:  

#### Set safety level

Safe (your default)

Moderate

Restricted

####   

#### Set content type

Photos (your default)

Screenshots

Art, illustration, CGI or other non-photographic images

  
Does this mean they will stop complaining that my ratio of photos to screenshots is too low ?
