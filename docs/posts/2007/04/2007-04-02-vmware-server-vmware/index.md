[VMware Server](http://www.vmware.com/products/server/) and [VMware Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/) are a great combination.

I've just built a VM on a Server host copied it to a Player host and just used VMware tools to shrink the guest VMDK from 3.2G to 1.4G ! Did Player always do this ?
