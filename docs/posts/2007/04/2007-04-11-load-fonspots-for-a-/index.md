#### Download the FONspots for a city or a country directly to your GPS or PDA

FON offers you a [new Points of Interest](https://www.fon.com/en/info/whatsNew) service (POIs). This allows you to download FONspots directly to your navigation device.

What does that mean? You can download a Points of Interest file directly to your navigation device. Then you can have your Tom Tom in your passenger seat guiding you directly to the nearest FONspot!

[Download](http://maps.fon.com/) the POIs to the most common navigation devices: For GPS Exchange Format (.gpx), for Garmin and Navman (.csv), for Tom Tom (.ov2) or even for Google Earth (.kml)

Most GPSs, PDAs and other navigation devices allow you to store POI data. A Point of Interest shows the location of a restaurant, Gas Station, and now a FONspot on your navigation device’s maps. Finding a FONspot was never this easy!
