In case no one happened to tell, you, CVS is dead. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. Oh, sure, people still use it, and it is still included in most Linux distributions, including Fedora™ Core, but it is quite dead. It died after a long, drawn-out sickness after years of neglect. Sadly, it died of the incurable disease 'broken architecture.' Nothing could be done besides making its final days (well, years) as comfortable as possible. But now, finally, gone it is, and its replacement is a much younger, much healthier, much better architected, and much more capable version control system—Subversion.
