I noticed the default Default 4.0 install enables/uses a root account (unlike Ubunutu) however I've just re-run the installer in `expertgui` mode and it gives me a choice of root or sudo modes !

Which mode is your favorite ?  

- (default)
- expert
- installgui
- expertgui  
    

Also `expertgui` mode lets you include the non-free repository at install time !
