How to create your own Web 3.0 Social Semantic Network (SSN) in minutes:

1. Choose a Web 2.0 or Web 3.0 social networking site such as VOX or [flickr](http://flickr.com/)
2. Enter a "keyword" or "tagword" into the group search
3. Join group(s) (that you like the look of)
4. Favoritise photo(s) in the groups (that you like the look of)
5. Make favorite photo poster a "neighbour/friend"
6. Then look at their groups (and "neighbours/friends")
7. REPEAT steps 3-6 as necessary  
    

In no time at all you'll have a Social Semantic Network of over 300 people & "groups" !
