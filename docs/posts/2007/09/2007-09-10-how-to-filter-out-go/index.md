Here's a tip for those of you who want to filter out Google Ads from your network, either because they show competitors or undesirable sites:

1. Go to your Google Adsense account and login;
2. Click on Adsense Setup (second tab);
3. Click on Competitive Ad Filter (last option);
4. Add the domains of as many ads you want to block.

In a few hours, you will no longer see them pop up.
