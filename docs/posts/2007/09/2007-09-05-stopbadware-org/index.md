[StopBadware.org](http://stopbadware.org/) is a "Neighborhood Watch" campaign aimed at fighting [badware](http://stopbadware.org/home/help). We will seek to provide reliable, objective information about downloadable applications in order to help consumers to make better choices about what they download on to their computers. We aim to become a central clearinghouse for research on badware and the bad actors who spread it, and to become a focal point for developing collaborative, community-minded approaches to stopping badware.

Harvard Law School's Berkman Center for Internet & Society and Oxford University's Oxford Internet Institute are leading this initiative with the support of several prominent tech companies, including [Google](http://groups.google.com/group/stopbadware), Lenovo, and Sun Microsystems. Consumer Reports WebWatch is serving as an unpaid special advisor.
