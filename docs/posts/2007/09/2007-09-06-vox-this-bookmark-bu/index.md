Last week, we pushed out Release 32 of Vox, the release notes for which can be found here. We turned out some cool features, but there's one new bit of functionality in there that we didn't tell you about yet. We're calling it Vox This and it's an API that allows you to easily bring content from other sites in to your Vox. For you Web 2.0 geeks out there, it's similar to the "Digg This" API, and we hope it's not long before we see other sites out there adding Vox This buttons to their pages.
