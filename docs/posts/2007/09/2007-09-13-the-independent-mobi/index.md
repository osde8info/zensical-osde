[The Independent](http://news.independent.co.uk) today gave away a blogging for beginners guide to its 1/4 million readers that featured VOX as "one of the easiest services to use" - and I absolutely agree !

I hope we can expect to see a massive influx of UK bloggers on VOX !

The Independent has produced a seven-part series, sponsored by Tesco Internet Phone  **[](http://www.tesco.com/internetphone)**[www.tesco.com/internetphone](http://www.tesco.com/internetphone), which looks at the basics of using a PC !

See [http://news.independent.co.uk/sci\_tech/article2915424.ece](http://news.independent.co.uk/sci_tech/article2915424.ece)

This series will take you right from the initial decisions - choosing a system, setting it up and getting connected to the internet - right through to such seemingly difficult applications as creating your own online photo album, finding new music or even making a video call to the other side of the world.

The first 36-page magazine focuses on Your Computer. The second magazine focuses on The Internet.

The other five booklets are: Music, Video, Social Networking, **Blogging \[**on Blogger and **VOX\]** and Communication.
