According to [http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/29/facebook-to-launch-friend-grouping/](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/29/facebook-to-launch-friend-grouping/) facebook has a 5,000 friend limit - even I haven't hit that one yet !

[Facebook![](http://i.ixnp.com/images/v2.24.0.1/t.gif)](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook) will finally [allow![](http://i.ixnp.com/images/v2.24.0.1/t.gif)](http://www.facebook.com/whatsnew.php) users to group friends and control information flow based on friend type. For guys like [Robert Scoble![](http://i.ixnp.com/images/v2.24.0.1/t.gif)](http://scobleizer.com/), who have 5,000 friends (the limit), this may be a way to finally sort through the real friends from the fans.

It’s a much needed feature that people [have been requesting![](http://i.ixnp.com/images/v2.24.0.1/t.gif)](http://www.allfacebook.com/2007/09/facebooks-killer-feature-coming-soon/) for a long time.
