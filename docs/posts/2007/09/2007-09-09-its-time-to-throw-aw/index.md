I think it's time to throw away your Thinkpad T20 because:

- it has a max capacity of only 512M RAM
- those 2 x 256M PC133 SODIMMs will cost you £80 (equiv to 1G / £160)
- you can now buy a brand new notebooks with 1G of RAM for £299 on the High St from Comet, Staples or Tesco !
- that brand new notebook will also have 80G+ disk (instead of 20G), 1.4G CPU (instead of 700MHz), built in Wi-Fi (instead of PCMCIA that sticks out) and a one year guarantee !
