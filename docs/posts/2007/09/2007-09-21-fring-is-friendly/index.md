[fring](http://www.fring.com/) is user friendly (and self promoting) !

![fring](http://www.fring.com/images/fringafriend_bot.gif)

[fring](http://www.fring.com/) automatically lets your MSN contacts know that :

- I'm mobile on fring www.fring.com !  
    

and your Skype contacts know that

- I'm are mobile on fring www.fring.com/skype (typing slowly & can't receive videos or files) !  
    

  
[fring](http://www.fring.com/) is a VOIP/IM solution that works on Symbian S60 series phones and lets you use GoogleTalk, MSN, Skype and make SIP VOIP calls wherever a GSM/EDGE/3G or WiFi connection is available !

PS I use it on a NOKIA E61i !
