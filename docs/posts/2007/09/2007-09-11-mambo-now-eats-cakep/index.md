On Saturday, we were pleasantly surprised to receive an email from the Chad Auld, project lead of Mambo, informing us that CakePHP will form the core for version 5 of the popular Mambo CMS. As you can read from their announcement\[1\] there are several reasons Mambo chose CakePHP, not the least of which were the clean separation, sensible conventions, and ability to write more maintainable and extensible code. We were happy to greet the Mambo team in IRC and we setup a communication channel to answer any questions they may have as they make the move to CakePHP.
