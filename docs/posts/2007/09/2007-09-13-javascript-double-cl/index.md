## Javascript (double-click function to any word on the page)

HEAD  
<script src="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.js"></script>

BODY  
<body ondblclick="dictionary()">

That's it.

Now when the visitors double-click any word on your site they will get an instant definition.

As recommended by [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/lookup.htm](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/lookup.htm)

PS If anyone knows how to add JavaScript to VOX please let me know !
