Thanks to [http://ocifant.vox.com/library/post/tidying-my-photos.html](http://ocifant.vox.com/library/post/tidying-my-photos.html) I have just discovered the Yahoo! ZoneTag and Zurfer BETA mobile phone apps !

ZoneTag  
ZoneTag can tag your photos with the location in which they were taken.

Zurfer  
Zurfer shows you photos taken around you, and exposes interesting 'local highlights'.

If you have a Symbian S60 (V2 ?) series phone you may like to give them a try !
