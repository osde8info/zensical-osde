NING have built some of their own components to ease the process of talking to popular web services such as Google Maps, Flickr, Yahoo!, and Amazon.

You can see Google Maps integration at work in the [Google Maps Skeleton](http://googleskeleton.ning.com/) -- it's just one line of PHP code to plop a map into your NING app!
