You know you're a [flickrholic](http://flickrati.groups.vox.com/) when

- you feel guilty about posting photos without tagging them
- you feel guilty about posting photos adding them to relevant groups

fortunately there are a couple of remedies you could try

- allow anyone to add tags to your photos
- hope that group admins invite your photos to their groups  
    

  
If you are not sure what your settings are you can check them at  
[http://www.flickr.com/account/?tab=privacy](http://www.flickr.com/account/?tab=privacy)

"Who will be able to see, comment on, and annotate your photos"

- See: **Anyone**
- Comment on: **Any Flickr user**
- Add notes and tags: **Any Flickr user**
