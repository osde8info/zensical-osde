### "We're sorry. Yahoo! Photos is closing on October 18, 2007 so we are no longer accepting new accounts or allowing users to upload photos if you don't already have photos in your account.  

### We've decided to focus all our efforts on Flickr - the award winning photo sharing community that has been called "completely addictive".  

### Why not [head over to Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) for a look?"

  
So it really and finally is true !
