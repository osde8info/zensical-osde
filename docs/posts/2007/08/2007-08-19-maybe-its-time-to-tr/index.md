### Why trash IE6 hacks?

I know this is difficult because about [37%](http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp) (according to [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/)) of internet users are still using IE6. But, together we can make a different. Stop using IE hacks on your sites and let them see the ugly side of IE6. Eventually, they will find a better browser (ie. Firefox) or at least upgrade to newer version of IE.
