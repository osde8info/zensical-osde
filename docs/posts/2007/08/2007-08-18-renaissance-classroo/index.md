I've heard of the OLPC but what is this ?

Imagine a classroom where ALL of your pupils are involved in the lesson ... where ALL of them are enthusiastic ... where you can interactively assess how they are doing using tests, audience reaction and formative assessments to help the teaching and learning process.

I think i prefer the BBC voting system where the audience wave light sabres in the air !
