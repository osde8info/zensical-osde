This is AMAZING and will change the way you upload to flickr forever !

[Uploadr](http://juploadr.org/) is an open source cross platform, cross site Photo uploader.

Currently it runs on Linux, OS X and AnotherOS and supports both Flickr and Zooomr.

It allows you to set all properties of a photo before you upload it. It also supports batch editing, so you can make short work of uploading a bunch of files.

PS On my Ed/X/Ubuntu systems you may need to uninstall GNU Java (GCJ) or rename /usr/bin/java to /usr/bin/java-gcj and edit the jUploadr shell script as follows :

`    ...   look_for_java()   {     JAVADIR=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.06   ...    `

If you like it why not stack it on ohloh [http://www.ohloh.net/projects/7816](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/7816)
