I missed this news when it was announced but if Yahoo! Mail can go to "infinity and beyond" for FREE then maybe Yahoo! flickr can too !

As Yahoo! Mail approaches its 10-year anniversary, I’m the lucky one who gets to announce that we will begin offering everyone unlimited email storage starting in May 2007. To mark the occasion, I checked in with [David Nakayama](http://www.dnak.com/ "David Nakayama"), our group vice president of engineering, for some perspective on this milestone. In case that name doesn’t ring a bell, he’s the developer of [RocketMail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RocketMail "RocketMail"), one of the world’s first webmail products, which Yahoo! acquired and relaunched as [Yahoo! Mail in 1997](http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=173314 "Yahoo! Mail in 1997")

Doesn't it make you proud to have been a pioneering RocketMail user (if like me you were one) !
