I have just tried CentOS 5 and am a bit disappointed

1. The LIVE-CD gives me a blank screen on my IBM Thinkpad
2. The INSTALL-DVD still doesn't have a graphical installer
3. I asked for a desktop build and (unless I misread something) its only created a root user and I first have to log in as that

I'm afraid I'm going to stick with [gNewSense](http://www.gnewsense.org/) & [Xubuntu](http://www.xubuntu.org/) for the moment at least for my desktops and notebooks !
