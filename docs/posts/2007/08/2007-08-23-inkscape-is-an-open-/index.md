[Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/) is an Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities similar to non open editors using the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) standard [Scalable Vector Graphics](http://w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) (SVG) file format.  

Supported SVG features include shapes, paths, text, markers, clones, alpha blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and grouping.  

Inkscape also supports [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) meta-data, node editing, layers, complex path operations, bitmap tracing, text-on-path, flowed text, direct XML editing, and more.  

It imports formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and others and exports PNG as well as multiple vector-based formats.

**You can easily run Inkscape INSIDE a [VMware Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/) [Ubuntu virtual machine](http://www.vmware.com/appliances/deploy/browse.html) EVEN if you are not running GNU/Linux directly on your desktop !
