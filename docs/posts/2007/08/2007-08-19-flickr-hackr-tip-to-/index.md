Create groups for each month and remember to upload old / hidden photos each and every month BEFORE they are automatically hidden !

For example for my flickr account here are my :

current (unhidden) photos  

- [http://www.flickr.com/photos/osde-info/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/osde-info/)

soon to be hidden photos  

- [http://www.flickr.com/groups/osde-info-2007-08/](http://www.flickr.com/groups/osde-info-2007-08/)
- [http://www.flickr.com/groups/osde-info-2007-07/](http://www.flickr.com/groups/osde-info-2007-07/)
