Another day means yet another article about facebook in the [metro](http://www.metro.co.uk/) !

Todays facebook story is  

- Half of firms ban facebook

Here are some other technology stories in todays [metro](http://www.metro.co.uk/)  

- Monster website cracked !
- Does Google have too many cookies ?
- Arm wrestling arcade game machine breaks three players arms !  
    
- [Extra-marital dating website](http://illicitencounters.com/) says men travel 212km to have affairs while women only travel 17km !  
    

BUT  
there are plenty of other social media networks out there so why do we never hear about VOX, NING, XING in the [metro](http://www.metro.co.uk/) ?

OR  
maybe PC Pro own the [metro](http://www.metro.co.uk/) and are slowly turning it into a daily newspaper for geeks and hackers !

Now that I would read EVERYDAY !
