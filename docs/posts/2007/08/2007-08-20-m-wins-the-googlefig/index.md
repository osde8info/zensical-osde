MS 581M v M$ 1700M

[http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en\_GB&word1=ms&word2=m%24](http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&word1=ms&word2=m%24)

What other terms can i use to stop M$ (sic) winning googlefights ? So far I've only been using :  
   

- M$
- AnotherOS
- BadBrowser

whenever i "have" to mention/refer to "that" company and "those" products !

Do you have any more/better suggestions ?
