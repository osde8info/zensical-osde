When adding a post I oftern want to add it to more than one group ! So could we have a multi-select list and Groups Of Groups grouping (via tags) !

For example I'm likely to want to post an article about photography to Amateur Photographers, Photographers, Photo Editing and unlikely to post it to Ambient, Ecology etc etc

Just have a look at ohloh which uses artifical intelligence to think of appropriate tags for a post maybe VOX could do the same to auto suggest VOX tags & groups
