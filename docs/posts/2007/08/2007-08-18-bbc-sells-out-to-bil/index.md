The Free Software Foundation (FSF) mounted its protests against "corruption" of the BBC by Microsoft in London and Manchester this morning.

The BBC says its content partners **will not allow it to distribute shows over the internet without Microsoft DRM.**

The Open Source Consortium, a separate open source advocacy group, has been pursuing the multi-platform thread of the iPlayer openness row through Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading, and the BBC Trust.  

It has now arranged a meeting with BBC management for mid-October and is preparing an approach to EU competition regulators.

Maybe now is the time to [Throw Away Your TV](http://tayt.groups.vox.com/) (and stop paying the BBC £120 per year) !
