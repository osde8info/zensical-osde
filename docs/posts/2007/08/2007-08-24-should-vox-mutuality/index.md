I've created a similar group [http://reciprocity.groups.vox.com/](http://reciprocity.groups.vox.com/) and am thinking of merging the two

Would that make sense ?

In any case please join [http://reciprocity.groups.vox.com/](http://reciprocity.groups.vox.com/) if you are interested !

PS I've tried to invite all "Mutual Friends" to [http://reciprocity.groups.vox.com/](http://reciprocity.groups.vox.com/) but due a MAJOR irritation with VOX the group member drop down lists users in a DIFFERENT order (uses nicknames ?) to the names listed in group members page (uses aliases ?) so it is almost impossible to find you amongst my 100's of contacts if ALL your name variants are NOT the same as in most cases !
