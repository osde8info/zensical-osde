I finally decided to unify all my different "social network" (flickr, ning, nowpublic, vox, xing) avatars, icons & logos.

Many people have been recommending the GNU Image Manipulation Program ( [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) ) to me but I've never tried it before !

Because everyone says GIMP is amazing I (foolishly) assumed that meant it was easy to use (wrong!) and that I wouldn't need to read the manual (wrong again!)

After wasting 2 hrs trying to create my new icon I decided to read the first 100 pages of

and now it's just taken me 15 mins to create the following two logos !  
  
One for "people" focused "social networks" and one for "technology" focused social networks !

What do you think ? Does this consistently get my "brand image" across to both sorts of social networks ? Interestingly the mini photo in the top right corner looks smaller on the second image ! Have I made a mistake in GIMP or is this just an optical illusion ?
