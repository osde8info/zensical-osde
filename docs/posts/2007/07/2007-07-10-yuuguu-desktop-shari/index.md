[Yuuguu](http://www.yuuguu.com/about_product.php) is a tool that lets you see, share and take control of each other’s computer screens and applications.

Yuuguu also lets you speak to and message individuals and groups whilst you screen share so it feels like you're together in the same room.

Yuuguu shows you when your workmates and friends are online too, so you can switch them ‘on’ when you want them, and ‘off’ when you don’t.
