SO I'm a member of Hamburg & Istanbul VOX groups but I really hadn't expected to see adverts for "Flights from Hamburg to Istanbul" from [Lufthansa](http://www.lufthansa.com/online/portal/lh/uk/homepage) on my VOX page !

Is this what they mean by Yahoo! Smart adverts ? Plus I thought VOX used Google instead of Yahoo!
