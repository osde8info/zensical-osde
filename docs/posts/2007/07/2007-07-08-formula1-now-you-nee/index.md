Now you need a TV and two Java enabled notebooks to watch the [F1](http://www.formula1.com/services/live_timing/) "live action" with "live timing" and "lap chart" ! Of course if you have a third notebook you can watch  "weather & wind" too !

This should give you a total sports "immersion" experience !
