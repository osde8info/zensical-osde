# [Stockphoto - Stock Photographer Training Manual](http://www.istockphoto.com/tutorial_9.0_modelrelease.php)

  

**9.0 - Model Release:**

1. All photographs where an identifiable human face is present require a model release. There are no exceptions.
2. If the photograph is of a minor (a child under the age of 18), a model release must be signed by a parent or legal guardian.
3. If the photo is of the photographer (a self portrait), a model release is still required.
4. A model release should be uploaded with each file. If you're uploading successive shots of the same model, the model release should be uploaded with each shot.
5. A valid witness signature must appear on the model release. Generally, it should be someone other than the photographer.
