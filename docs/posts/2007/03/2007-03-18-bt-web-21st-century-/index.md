BT is undergoing a complete transformation. At the heart of this transformation is our £10 billion 21st century network (21CN) initiative. An IP-based, multi-service network, 21CN is the driver for a radical change.

As part of this change, we are kicking off a ground-breaking project, code-named Web21C. In Phase I, BT has begun to expose a number of capabilities to developers such as yourselves. We’re in the early stages. There’s a lot more functionality—powerful, low cost functionality—to come.

We want your help. In this Developer Centre, we introduce the Web21C SDK beta, for .NET (Visual Studio), Java, Python and PHP. Check out the components of our SDK.  

Tell us what’s missing. Tell us what’s bad. Tell us what’s good.
