### What is [Cairngorm](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Cairngorm)?

The Cairngorm Microarchitecture is a lightweight yet prescriptive framework for rich Internet application (RIA) development.

Cairngorm is an implementation of design patterns that the consultants at Adobe Consulting have successfully taken from enterprise software development (with technologies including J2EE and .NET) and applied rich Internet application development using Adobe Flex.

Flex 1.5 and Flex 2

Cairngorm is available for both Flex 1.5 and the newly-released Flex 2 framework. All current efforts are focused on the version for Flex 2 and all references to Cairngorm in this article refer to Cairngorm for Flex 2, unless otherwise stated.
