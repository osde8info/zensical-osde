I have been noticing that 80% of ads that VOX shows me are actually relevant to me i.e. they are actually about LAMP, UNIX, SysAdmin, WebDev. Does that mean I'm now a complete [VOXaholic](http://voxaholic.groups.vox.com/) ?

I have now just clicked on someones favorite book and the Amazon advert was so cleverly integrated that I actually thought it was an internal VOX link !

If VOX keeps this up they will make € millions !
