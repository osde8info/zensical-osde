Went to London's [http://www.socialmediaclub.com/](http://www.socialmediaclub.com/). Tonight's topic was "Music & Sound".

If you want to hear what you missed you should be able to download a netcast/podcast from their blog [http://smclondon.ning.com/](http://smclondon.ning.com/) or from their wiki [http://socialmediaclub.pbwiki.com/London](http://socialmediaclub.pbwiki.com/London).

I'm looking forward to going again.
