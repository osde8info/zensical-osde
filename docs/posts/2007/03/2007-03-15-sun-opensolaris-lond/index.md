It was a mixed bag at today's [Sun Tech Day](http://uk.sun.com/sunnews/events/2007/mar/revolution/techdays07/index.html)

**"The Zen of Free"** (part 1.5 !) by Simon Phipps, Chief Open Source Officer, Sun inc, who is always worth watching even if he is saying the same thing !

**"VMware"** hadn't been told NOT to do a marketing presentation and deservedly got heckled ! In the "good old days" VMware would have been booed off stage !  
**  
"jMaki & AJAX hands on lab"** 10 out of 10 ! I will actually try NetBeans now !

LUNCH

**"AMD"** I think everyone was just there to win the prize draw for a Solaris Workstation !  
   
**"Future of Java: Open Source Projects and Communities"** Interesting but I'm already a believer !

**"Mobile J2ME drag drop app building with NetBeans"** OK ! OK ! I get the point ! I will try NetBeans !
