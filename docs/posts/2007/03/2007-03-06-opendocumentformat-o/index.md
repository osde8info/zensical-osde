There are quite a few organisations involved in the Open Document Format (ODF):

[OpenDocument XML.org](http://opendocument.xml.org/)  
The official community gathering place and information resource for the OpenDocument OASIS Standard (ISO/IEC 26300). OpenDocument provides a format that enables users of varying office suites to freely exchange documents.

[The OpenDocument Foundation, Inc.](http://opendocument.us/)  
A 501c(3) non profit chartered to work in the public interest to support, promote and develop the OASIS OpenDocument File Format affectionately known as "ODf".  

[ODF Alliance](http://www.odfalliance.org/)  
Works globally to educate policymakers, IT administrators and the public on the benefits and opportunities of the OpenDocument Format, to help ensure that government information, records and documents are fully and natively accessible across platforms and applications, even as technologies change.

[OASIS](http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/index.php#opendocumentv1.0)  
Standards are approved within an OASIS Committee, submitted for public review, implemented by at least three organizations, and finally ratified by the Consortium's membership at-large.
