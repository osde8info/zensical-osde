VideoLAN is a software [project](http://www.videolan.org/project), which produces [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) for video, released under the GNU [General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). Our main product is the cross-platform VLC media player.

The VideoLAN streaming solution includes two programs:

- [VLC media player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc) which can be used as a _server_ and as a _client_ to stream and receive network streams. VLC is able to stream all that it can read.
- VLS (VideoLAN Server), which can stream MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 files, DVDs, digital satellite channels, digital terrestial television channels and live videos on the network in unicast or multicast. Most of the VLS functionality can now be found VLC.  
    
- **Usage of VLC instead of VLS is advised.**
