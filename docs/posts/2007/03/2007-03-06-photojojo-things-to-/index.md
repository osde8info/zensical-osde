[Photojojo](http://www.photojojo.com/) is a newsletter about "a whole world of things you can do with your photos and with your camera that nobody ever told you about. Turn a photo into a mural at home in 5 minutes, print your friends' faces onto cupcakes, or get a bottlecap that turns any soda bottle into a tripod ..."
