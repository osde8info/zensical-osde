There seems to be a problem with editing XFCE desktop menus. You can't ! However you can tinker with \*.desktop in /usr/share/applications menu.

"The problem is you can't edit most of the xfce4 menu with the menu editor. Even many of the xfce community agree that the menu editor is almost useless. I have, however, found a way to change things in the system menu. Create new .desktop files in ~/.local/share/applications and those new meu items will show up in the xfce4 menu immediately.. at least they did for me."
