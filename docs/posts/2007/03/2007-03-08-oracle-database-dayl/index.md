On March 11th, 2007, the new daylight saving time rules in the United States and Canada begin.

These new rules may require that you [patch](http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/notes/daylight-saving-time-update-guide.html?msgid=5445142) your Oracle8i, Oracle9i, Oracle Database 10g databases and Oracle clients because of the changes to these rules.

Earlier Oracle releases do not require daylight saving time patches.
