"The future is OPEN" by James Gosling kicked off Day 2. Even though it was a Sun Java Tech Day, James Gosling and many other speakers did not seem to stop talking about:  

- AJAX
- Flickr
- Google Web Toolkit
- Ruby on Rails
- Web Services
- Yahoo Maps API  
    

It seems that every new NetBeans plugin has been designed to support Java with THESE services !

This is Web 3.0 ! Web 3.0 is the future !
