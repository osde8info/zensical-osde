SchoolTool is a project to develop a common global school administration infrastructure that is freely available under an Open Source license. 

SchoolTool encompasses three sub-projects:  

- [SchoolTool Calendar](http://www.schooltool.org/products/schooltool-calendar) and [SchoolBell](http://www.schooltool.org/products/schooltool-calendar) are calendar and resource management tools for schools available as part of the [Edubuntu Linux](http://edubuntu.org/) distribution.
- A [SchoolTool student information system](http://www.schooltool.org/st-products/schooltool-2006/index_html "SchoolTool Student Information System") is being developed and tested in collaboration with schools in Lithuania and Belgium during the 2006 - 2007 school year
- [CanDo](http://www.schooltool.org/st-products/cando/cando-student-competency-tracker "CanDo06 Student Competency Tracker") is a SchoolTool-based skills tracking program developed by Virginia students and teachers to track which skills students are acquiring in their classes and at what level of competency.
