You love OpenOffice, but you still use another app to make drawings.  

Why? Because none of the shapes you need are easily available. Until now.

[Custom OO Shapes](http://www.lautman.net/mark/coo/index.html) is a repository of custom shapes you can use with the open source OpenOffice.Org Draw drawing app
