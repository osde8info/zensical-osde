### Sun’s Open Source Contribution: $2 Billion, Dozens of Projects

Did you know that Sun contributes more than $200 million per year of intellectual property to the open source movement, in dozens of [open source projects](http://www.sun.com/opensource)?  

The company’s historical contribution tops $2 billion. WOW!

This month on SDNtv, tune in for a four-part look at Sun’s open source strategy and take a close look at several open source projects and how you can get involved.

In this week’s episode, guest host Dan Roberts (standing in for new daddy, Mark Herring) chats with [Simon Phipps](http://www.webmink.net/), Sun’s chief open source officer.  

Tune in to hear Phipps explain how open source is radically changing the computer industry.

Stay tuned next week as Phipps hosts the Open Source Java Special.  

You'll hear about [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.dev.java.net/), the new open source JDK project along with [Project GlassFish](https://glassfish.dev.java.net/).
