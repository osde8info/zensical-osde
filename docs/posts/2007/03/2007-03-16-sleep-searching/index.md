Look slowly over both shoulders. (Don’t make it obvious. But don’t make it look like you’re not being obvious.) Is anyone watching? If not, proceed to the next paragraph. (Just don’t make it look like you’re going to the next paragraph.)

  
Did you know that more than 75% of people in the UK use just one search engine to find information?  

The same search engine. The biggest search engine. The most popular search engine. Why? It’s not that there aren’t choices, it’s just that people don’t use them. We did some research and found that 62% of Internet users in the UK don’t think about which search engine they use.  

  
We call that Sleep Searching. And we don’t think that’s right. So we’re fighting back before things get out of hand. Raging against the machine, so to speak. The machine of conventional wisdom!

We want to spread the message to try something new, to think differently, to be your own person, to break away from the herd. Join the [Information Revolution](http://information-revolution.org/) !
