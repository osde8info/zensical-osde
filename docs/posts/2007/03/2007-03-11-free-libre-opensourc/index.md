I'm sure [rms](http://www.stallman.org/) has some excellent analogies but here are a few i just thought of :  

- Telling a programmer to use a Proprietary Software Package to produce a system is like telling an artist to use a painting-by-numbers book to produce a painting of a tree !
- A Proprietary Software Package is like a car made of [Meccano](http://www.meccano.com/) that is superglued together !
- An OpenSource Package is like a car made of [Meccano](http://www.meccano.com/) that the programmer can take apart and turn into an aeroplane !

Closed Proprietary Software **stifles creativity** just like a painting-by-numbers book.
