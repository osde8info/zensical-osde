Why are [Swik](http://swik.net/) or [Wikia](http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Wikia) better than [Digg](http://www.digg.com/) or [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/)?  

Traditional communities are finite realms constraining the infinite power of the human mind!

I am not suggesting that Swik or Wikia are the answers to the world's problems, but they are a damned sight closer than the noise, adolecence and chaos of most communities out there right now. Face it folks cute don't always get it done!

Alex Bosworth and others have been creating innovative and provocative works like the Web 2.0 area at [SourceLabs](http://sandbox.sourcelabs.com/wikiality/web2.0). Here you will find hundreds of hours of work revealing a consolidation of blogs unlike any I have seen, and simple mouseovers help navigation in the cleanest way.  

Created with what Alex termed "bozpages", this simple organization of data looks ripe for the addition of your own personal touches. Swik is a work in progress, and it will take people to transform it into anything like I have suggested.
