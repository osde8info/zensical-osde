**xserver-xorg-core**

i know its always risky (i've trashed 4 installs so far) upgrading your xserver

but there are some compelling security reasons to upgrade to  
version 1.0.2-0ubuntu10.5 (SECURITY UPDATE)

- Arbitrary code execution with root privileges via heap overflows in DBE and Render extensions.

- Add 'debian/patches/993\_ubuntu\_dbe-render\_overflows.dpatch' from upstream
- References    CVE-2006-6101 CVE-2006-6102 CVE-2006-6103
