MS [odf-converter](http://odf-converter.sourceforge.net/) provides an Add-in to **Word XP/2003/2007** to allow opening and saving OpenDocument format (ODF) files.

The converter is based on XSL transformations between two XML formats, along with some pre- and post-processing to manage the packaging (zip / unzip), schema incompatibility processings and the integration into Word. Along with the Add-in, we also provide a command line translator that allows doing  
batch conversions. This translator could also be run on the server side for certain scenarios.

[Sun](http://sun.com) announced today that it would make a "preview" version of its Office to ODF plugin in "mid February," with the full version to follow "later this spring."  Plugins will be available for use with both Sun's StarOffice as well as the open source OpenOffice.org office suite. 

The announcement comes five days after [Microsoft announced](http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/02/02/HNopenxmltranslator_1.html) the immediate availability of its Office to ODF plugin at SourceForge.
