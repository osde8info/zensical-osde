### [What happens after Google loses?](http://scobleizer.com/2007/03/14/what-happens-after-google-loses/)

I’ve been thinking about what happens after Google loses [its $1 billion lawsuit that it’s facing at the hands of Viacom](http://www.techmeme.com/070313/p38#a070313p38).

It’s going to take until 2008 for this to play out. So, what will late 2008 look like? Well, hundreds of millions of new video cameras will be in people’s hands between now and then. The cost of bandwidth distribution will fall at a quick rate. Amazon S3 charges right now about $.15 per gigabyte of stuff delivered. Watch what happens after Ray Ozzie jumps into the market. I bet that by late 2008 the cost per gigabyte delivered will be about 1/10th that.
