Todays Sun Tech Day was an inspirational and motivating as ever

**The Zen of Free** by [Simon Phipps](http://www.webmink.net/) (impressive yet again) (he's already blogged [his morning](http://www.webmink.net/2007/03/message-to-scd43.htm) in London)  

- Open Source is Topology of Society
- Closed Source is a closed room with none of the smart people
- Open Source is an open room with all of the smart people
- not giving back is bad for you
- no-one has ever forked Apache
- Open Source gives customer choice of what to spend their money on : service, support, staff or risk it !
- 26% of Debian has been written by Sun (9% by IBM 5% by RedHat)
- As well as OpenOffice.org Sun also contibute to Gnome and Mozilla (i18n)

Collaborate, Compete & Contribute

**OpenSolaris Kernel Debugging  
**Kicked off to a great start when the audience was asked "Does anyone here actually do any kernel debugging" and of course none of us did ! Sound advice included "If you don't understand this (patching opcodes in memory) then don't do it". And topped off with "I never did figure out why the system failed at midnight - but a fix is a fix".

**Building and Deploying OpenSolaris  
**Did you know  

- 2000 users in Poland have registered on OpenSolaris.org
- There are already 7 distros based on OpenSolaris
- Nexenta distro uses GNU Debian packages and Ubuntu apps
- Schillx is a live CD distro

We want you to contribute easiest to start with a bite sized bug that you are interested in

**OpenSolaris Virtualisation Technologies  
**OpenSolaris supports  

- XEN with guests on ZFS  
    
- Zones   
    

CentOS 3 or Red Hat RHEL 3 can run using a Solaris kernel instead of Linux (so you can use dtrace etc etc)

**New Security Features in OpenSolaris  
**Trusted Extensions  

- Similar to SE linux (in my view)
- Processes and resources have labels
- Uses Zones
- Can prevent cut & paste between Gnome windows with different security levels (SE linux doesn't do this)
