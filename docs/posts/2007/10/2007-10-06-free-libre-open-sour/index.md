SourceForge now lets you search for open source Projects with Service and Support (currently 188)

- [http://sourceforge.net/search/?type\_of\_search=projectsWithServices](http://sourceforge.net/search/?type_of_search=projectsWithServices)

  
and you search for a Service Providers (currently 390)

- [http://sourceforge.net/services/buy/service\_providers.php](http://sourceforge.net/services/buy/service_providers.php)

  
I am sure these lists will grow !
