The Horde Project is about creating high quality Open Source [applications](http://www.horde.org/projects.php), based on PHP and the Horde Framework.

The guiding principles of the Horde Project are to create solid standards-based applications using intelligent object oriented design that, wherever possible, are designed to run on a wide range of platforms and backends.  
There is great emphasis on making Horde as friendly to non-English speakers as possible. The Horde Framework currently supports many localization features such as unicode and right-to-left text and generous users have contributed [many translations](http://www.horde.org/localization.php) for the framework and applications.

Currently Horde Project boasts [many applications](http://www.horde.org/projects.php), some already enterprise-ready and deployed in demanding [environments](http://wiki.horde.org/display.php?page=Deployments), and some exciting new ones still in development.
