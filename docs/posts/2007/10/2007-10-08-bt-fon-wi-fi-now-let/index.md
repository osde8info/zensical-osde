Previously you had to chose between free worldwide wi-fi roaming or making money but NOW you can do BOTH !

# Roam for free and make money with your WiFi !

Foneros can now both connect for free and make a little money by participating in the FON Community. It’s easy. Every time a visitor (non-Fonero) detects your WiFi signal there’s a good chance you can make a bit of “dinero”.
