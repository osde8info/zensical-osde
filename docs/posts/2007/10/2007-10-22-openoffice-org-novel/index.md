The [Novell edition of OpenOffice.org](http://www.novell.com/products/openworkgroupsuite/openoffice.html) includes a word processor, presentation and spreadsheet applications, an HTML editor, and a drawing tool. It's all you need to create, process, review and revise the documents required in daily business.

  
This version of OpenOffice.org has extensive file-format compatibility with Microsoft Office, allowing users to better share files between platforms. SUSE® Linux Enterprise Desktop includes fonts that are geometrically compatible with Microsoft fonts to provide better format fidelity when reading native Microsoft Office files. OpenOffice.org also exports documents in Adobe portable document format (PDF) with no additional software required.

While not an exact feature-for-feature match to Microsoft Office, OpenOffice.org provides the majority of functionality your users are used to in their daily business. The user interface requires little retraining for current Windows and Microsoft Office users and the file-import and export tools ensure that users never have to worry about file formats when collaborating with Microsoft Office users.
