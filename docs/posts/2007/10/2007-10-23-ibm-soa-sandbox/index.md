![SOA Sandbox logo](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/i/d-dl-f-soasandbox.jpg)_The IBM® SOA Sandbox lets you increase your SOA skills through practical, hands-on experience with the IBM SOA entry points. These SOA entry points -- people, process, information, reuse, and connectivity -- are based upon real customer experiences and provide a simple way to get started with SOA. The SOA Sandbox makes it easy to learn about these entry points by providing a low-risk "tinker, test, and try" learning environment that's designed for enterprise architects, integration developers, and Web developers, but available to everyone._

_The IBM SOA Sandbox provides a mix of full-version software trials and "try online" hosted environments where you can explore tutorials and get architectural guidance. You'll also find online demos, best practice documentation, and quick-start guides, all integrated into a low-risk, hands-on format that provides practical applications of SOA entry points to accelerate learning._
