Free Libre Open Source isn't the same as free-of-charge ! Free Libre Open Source is much more about the ethics and even politics of "freedom" !

_The Open Source paradigm is producing very high quality code and Open Source companies (and increasingly, traditionally closed source ones) are providing real value to clients with this code.  
_  
_What’s really driving the adoption of open source software is "freedom" ..._ _open standards, a lack of usage restrictions, and not being locked into a single software vendor as their primary reasons for looking at or adopting open source solutions ... the ability to customize these packages to specific business uses - especially in vertical markets._

_Freedom is key._
