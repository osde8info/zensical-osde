According to (a fairly long) Sun Webcast (with no << or >> so pay close attention)

- "employees _connect_ to work instead of going to work"
- "personal activities blur with enterprise activities"

Alternatively download the PDF of the presentation and you see that Slide 13 says it all !

It sounds to me like the future has already arrived at Sun and that OSAAS and SAAS are the future for 2015 !

Sun : "Think different ! You no longer need an IT dept" ! Do you think Sun are right about the future again ?
