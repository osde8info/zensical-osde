Did you know that if you are running Apache you already have a HTTP benchmarking tool called [ApacheBench](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html) aka [`ab`](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html) !

Theres a list of all the tools you get with Apache @ [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/) including [`logresolve`](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/logresolve.html) which is a post-processing program to resolve IP-addresses in Apache's access logfiles !

Finally there a great list of Open Source performance testing tools @ [http://www.opensourcetesting.org/performance.php](http://www.opensourcetesting.org/performance.php)
