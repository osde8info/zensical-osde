The objective of the [ADIOS](http://os.cqu.edu.au/adios/) project is to quickly and easily download a consistent operating system environment onto laboratory PCs.  The ADIOS environment provides students with administrative privileges required to perform advanced exercises in Network and Systems Administration.

We needed a way to download a pre-installed version of the operating system onto the PC in the laboratory.  There are many tools available to do this, but the ADIOS project uses a web server to deliver the Operating System images. 

The ADIOS setup image is used to install operating systems onto disk partitions.  It also copies the OS images from disk to disk to reduce network traffic.  The ADIOS image was ported onto CDROM for students to use at home.

ADIOS-SELinux is a separate boot CD for running NSA Security Enhanced Linux. Additional software is available on the DVD version of ADIOS.
