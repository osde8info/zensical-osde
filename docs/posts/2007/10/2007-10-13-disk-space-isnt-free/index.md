Disk space isn't free - its one pence per ten gibibytes !

Well thats my calculation based on the 8p price difference between a 250G and 320G USB disks in my local Staples store

- 250G £59.91
- 320G £59.99

I offered to take the obsolete 250G off their hands for 25p but surprisingly they declined !

Now I know very little about Sales & Marketing but if I was their Sales Manager I would have either knocked 50% the price of the 250G drive or hidden the 320G drives in a dark room UNTIL I'd sold all the 250G drives !

Should consumers be given the choice (to make bad decisions - ie not paying 8p extra for 70G) ?
