To quote other blogs you could start by just using _italics_ or follow some or all of these _official_ instructions:

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=citmed.section.61024](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=citmed.section.61024)  

_In citing a blog, note that:_

- _The word blog may or may not be a part of the title. If it is not, using the content type "blog" is strongly recommended._
- _Many blogs are self-published, with the author and the publisher the same individual._
- _Place of publication may be absent. Use the author's city as the place if one is not provided._
- _Blogs often omit giving the date the blog began. If no beginning date is found, use the date of the earliest message posted (usually found under Archive) and place it in square brackets._
- _Many blogs have new content added daily or very frequently. A date of update/revision is therefore not useful and is omitted from a citation._

In future I'll try harder to use some of these recommendations !
