_Its offerings are versions of open-source software developed in a consortium called [OpenOffice.org](http://openoffice.org/). The original code traces its origins to a German company, Star Division, which [Sun Microsystems](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/sun_microsystems_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org "More information about Sun Microsystems Inc.") bought in 1999. Sun later made the desktop software, now called StarOffice, an open-source project, in which work and code are freely shared._

_I.B.M.’s engineers have been working with OpenOffice technology for some time. But last week, I.B.M. declared that it was formally joining the open-source group, had dedicated 35 full-time programmers to the project and would contribute code to the initiative._
