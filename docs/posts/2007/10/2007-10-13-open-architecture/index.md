[Open Architecture Network](http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/)

Architects, designers, engineers and anyone else involved in the building trades is welcome to share their ideas on the network - but the network is not just for professionals. Community leaders, nonprofit groups, volunteer organizations, government agencies, technology partners, healthcare workers, educators and others are also invited to collaborate on projects and share their expertise. After all if we're to meaningfully address the challenges of building a sustainable future, we'll need (a lot of) help from people of all walks of life.

Far from replacing the traditional architect, the goal of the [Open Architecture Network](http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/) is to allow designers to work together in a whole new way, a way that enables 5 billion potential clients to access their skills and expertise.

The [Open Architecture Network](http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/) has a simple mission: **to generate not one idea but the hundreds of thousands of design ideas needed to improve living conditions for all.**
