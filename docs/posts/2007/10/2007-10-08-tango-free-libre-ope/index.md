The [Tango Desktop Project](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project) defines an [icon style guideline](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines "Tango Icon Theme Guidelines") to which artists and designers can adhere. A sample implementation of the style is available as an [icon theme](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library "Tango Icon Library") based upon a standardized [icon naming specification](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Standard_Icon_Naming_Specification "Standard Icon Naming Specification"). In addition, the project provides transitional utilities to assist in creating icon themes for existing desktop environments, such as [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/ "http://www.gnome.org") and [KDE](http://www.kde.org/ "http://www.kde.org").
