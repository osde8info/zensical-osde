The M$ Internet Explorer Weblog has announced that the latest update to Internet Explorer 7 will drop the Windoz Genuine Advantage (WGA) validation step from the installer.

Sitepoint claim that "although the announcement stops just shy of saying it, the real effect of this move is to allow people running pirated versions of Windoz XP and Windoz Server 2003 to get the IE7 upgrade !"
