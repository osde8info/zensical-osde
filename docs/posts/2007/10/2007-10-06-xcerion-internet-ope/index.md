[Xcerion Internet Operating System/3](http://xcerion.com/internet-os/) (XIOS/3) the clean, carefree, zero-footprint XML-based OS, running within the browser. Since the OS and its applications executes in the browser it also works offline.

The Internet OS boots itself (takes around 3 seconds) and runs in the primary memory of the computer. As soon as the browser is shut down, the OS disappears from the computer.

Using XIOS/3 you never has to think about installing patches, updates or new versions of software again.

The OS updates itself and you can access your applications and documents from any Internet connected computer.
