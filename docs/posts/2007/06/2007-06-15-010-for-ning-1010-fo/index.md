Not only does NING still only let you create ten social networks you have to upload the same content to EVERY SINGLE social group/network separately !

For example I have just had to SEPARATELY upload a single photo of a "NOKIA E61i-1" to NOKIA, E60, S60, Wi-Fi, Wireless, UK Mobile etc etc !

For example I have just had to SEPARATELY post a blog on "Apple Educational Resources" to Education, Teachers, Training, EducatorsLibrarians etc etc !

The NING photo upload process was the most painful because I had to name, describe, tag, geotag THE SAME PHOTO MULTIPLE TIME ! (NING doesn't do post tags so that wasn't a problem !)

It's almost as if NING actually don't want you to blog by making it as "painfull as possible" and I would love to stop wasting time on NING but there are a lot of interesting people on it (something it does share with VOX) ! Could you help me migrate them all over to VOX ?
