[Project Honey Pot](http://www.projecthoneypot.org/) is the first and only distributed system for identifying spammers and the spambots they use to scrape addresses from your website.

Using the Project Honey Pot system you can install addresses that are custom-tagged to the time and IP address of a visitor to your site.

If one of these addresses begins receiving email we not only can tell that the messages are spam, but also the exact moment when the address was harvested and the IP address that gathered it.

To participate in Project Honey Pot, webmasters need only install the Project Honey Pot software somewhere on their website. We handle the rest — automatically distributing addresses and receiving the mail they generate. As a result, we anticipate installing Project Honey Pot should not increase the traffic or load to your website.
