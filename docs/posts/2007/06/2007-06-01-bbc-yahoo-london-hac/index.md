Have you applied (and been accepted) yet to the [BBC Yahoo London Hack Day](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/173371) ?

[![Hack Day: London, June 16/17 2007](http://l.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/ydn/hackday/hack_day_pattern_twelve.gif)](http://www.hackday.org)

You’ve now got two weeks to start thinking about what kind of hack you want  
to build, and—if you want—to find other people to hack with.

This is what you need to know before the day:

- Doors open 9am at the Palm Court entrance of Alexandra Palace…
- Talks start at 10am and run to 2pm when the hacking begins…
- There will be wi-fi throughout, but no free computers. Bring your own!
- There will be space to sleep if you want to bring a sleeping bag…
