[BlueCat®](http://www.lynuxworks.com/embedded-linux/embedded-linux.php) embedded Linux® from LynuxWorks™

BlueCat® Linux® is first embedded-Linux distribution to incorporate the 2.6 kernel.

BlueCat® Linux® is an implementation of the Linux model enhanced for use in embedded systems ranging from small consumer-type devices to large-scale, multi-CPU systems.

## BlueCat Embedded Linux 5.x features

- **Preemptible kernel**— preemption points in the kernel allow you to suspend an executing process so that you can launch another, higher-priority process.
- **Low-latency scheduler**— ensures that processes are executed, giving users increased determinism
- **Improved POSIX® threading support**— open-standards ideology providing compatibility of applications over different architectures, complementing our LynxOS strategy
- **POSIX timers**— time and alarm management needed for real-time. Applications requiring high throughput or fast response time would benefit from these high-resolution timers

BlueCat Linux delivers the flexibility and cost benefits of open-source software.  

It's uniquely constructed to be a stable, commercial-grade embedded operating system release which provides immediate productivity and optimized performance.
