## [ACME GeoRSS Map Viewer](http://www.acme.com/GeoRSS/about.html)

#### Synopsis

This is a Google Maps app that displays GeoRSS files. It implements two different varieties of GeoRSS, plus all of Yahoo!'s enhancements to GeoRSS including address geocoding, plus a couple of things from basic RSS that Yahoo! missed. Feel free to use it with your own GeoRSS and Yahoo! Simple Map files.
