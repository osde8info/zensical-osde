_The open source software movement is probably the single most significant development to the software industry ever. Open source software is free. "Freely distributed", "Freely accessible" and "Freely modifiable" - and it is this freedom that makes it so valuable._

**CSC**

_The lure of open source software is that it is free—anyone can use it or modify it without license fees, and no vendor can lock users in for fixes and enhancements.

_A review of the implementation showed that it met each of the business objectives specified for the project. Additional functionality was subsequently incorporated into the product by AGIMO, Squiz.net and other Matrix users. This has increased the capabilities of the product and is expected to lead to reduced cost and development times for future functionality, as more and more code is available for re-use.

_Aside from being easy to implement, MySource Matrix also proved to be the most cost-effective site publishing solution for Oxford’s library network.  Because the CMS is open source, it’s free to use and own, meaning that OULS  & SERS have been able to control its development and support spend in a far more effective way than would be possible with alternative commercial systems._
