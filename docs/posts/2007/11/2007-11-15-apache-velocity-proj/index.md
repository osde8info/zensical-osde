[Apache Velocity Project](http://velocity.apache.org/) [About Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/)  

_Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use a simple yet powerful template language to reference objects defined in Java code._

_When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers can focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java code from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over its lifespan and providing a viable alternative to [Java Server Pages](http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/) (JSPs) or [PHP](http://www.php.net/)._
