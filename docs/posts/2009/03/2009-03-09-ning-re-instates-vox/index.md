Yes after six months of campaining [NING](http://blog.ning.com/2009/03/the-new-ningcom.html) have just reinstated a number of "VOX" like multi social media network features ! On the 'new' NING you can now :

- See email notifications from all your NING networks in one place !
- Set default settings for all NEW NING networks !
- See which OTHER NING networks your friends are members of ! (it's no longer TOP SECRET information if you WERE relying on this !)  
    

However its still takes a few 1000 clicks to sync your preferences across all your existing NING networks (if you are a member of 50 or more) !

Thank You NING and keep following (re-enabling and adding) VOX like features and we'll keep following you !
