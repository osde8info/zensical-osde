The [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/index.php) Project is an open-source community initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the Apple Mac OS X operating system.

> _To that end we provide the command-line driven MacPorts software package under a BSD License, and through it easy access to thousands of ports that  greatly simplify the task of compiling and installing open-source software on your Mac.  
> We provide a single software tree that attempts to track the latest release of every software title (port) we distribute, without splitting them into “stable” Vs. “unstable” branches, targetting mainly the current Mac OS X release (10.5, A.K.A Leopard) and the immediately previous one (10.4, A.K.A. Tiger).  
> There are currently 5602 ports in our tree, distributed among 90 different categories._
