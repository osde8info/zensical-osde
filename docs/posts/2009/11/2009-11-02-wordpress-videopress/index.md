With WordPress VideoPress you can _just upload a video, we’ll “crunch” it into several different formats just right for sharing on the web, DVD quality, HD quality, and even formats optimized for iTunes and [Miro](http://www.getmiro.com/). Preview your uploaded video, then embed the video and publish your post._
