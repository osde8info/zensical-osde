**Yahoo! YAP  
**The [Yahoo! Application Platform](http://developer.yahoo.com/yap/) allows you _to reach our users and improve the Yahoo! user experience by building and deploying new experiences for them into Yahoo! pages, writing code the way you love to write it. We're looking to you to help us build the next big thing on Yahoo!, and in turn we'll shower you with traffic and users._
