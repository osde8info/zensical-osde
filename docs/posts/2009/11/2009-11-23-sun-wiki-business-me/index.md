Sun have created a [Sun Wiki / Business Media Network](http://wikis.sun.com/dashboard.action) with over 20,000 members.

However it seems to be a closed community so you may need to create a [Sun Online Account](https://reg.sun.com/register) before you can see any content or [my profile](http://wikis.sun.com/display/%7Eosde8info) !
