At last nights [Eclipse Demo Camp London](http://www.eclipse.org/community/news/eclipsenews.php) the European Director of Eclipse Foundation inc, [Ralph Mueller](http://ralph-mueller.net/), did a great presentation on why Eclipse is different to other open source projects such as Apache or MySql !

It turns out that [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) is actually an [Ecosystem](http://dev.eclipse.org/blogs/mike/2009/09/24/differentiating-communities/) !

If you weren't there last night then you might like to go to [Eclipse Demo Camp Hamburg](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2009/Hamburg) next month !
