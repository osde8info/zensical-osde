WebTide Java Jetty HTTP Server _is an open-source, standards-based, full-featured web server implemented entirely in Java. It is released under the Apache 2.0 [licence](http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/LICENSE.TXT) and is therefore free for commercial use and distribution. First created in 1995, Jetty has benefitted from input from a vast user community and consistent and focused development by a stable core of lead developers. There are many more examples of Jetty in action on the [Jetty Powered Page](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Jetty+Powered) that has selections from among the tens of thousands of production Jetty instances._
