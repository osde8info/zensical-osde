**Turbo: Speed up WordPress**

_[WordPress](http://wordpress.com) now has support for [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com/), which adds new features to your web browser. After you install and enable Gears, most of WordPress’ images, scripts, and CSS files will be stored locally on your computer.  
This speeds up page load time but don’t install on a public or shared computer._
