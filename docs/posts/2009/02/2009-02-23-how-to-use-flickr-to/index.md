I've just noticed that Argos have some interesting deals on digital cameras:

- 7M Canon A470 3.4x for £50
- 10M Nikon S560 5x for £150
- 6M Nikon D40 DSLR (inc 18-55 lens) for £250

but how can i decide which one to buy ?

So I thought lets use flickr to help me decide

Only 200 A470 owners uploaded photos YESTERDAY but 3000 D40 owners did !

31/75 flickr members own a A470 ! and its well down the popularity list ! whats wrong with it ?

6000/13000 flickr members own the d40 and its the 4th most popular Nikon ! impressive figures !

Or maybe I should save up for a D60 instead !
