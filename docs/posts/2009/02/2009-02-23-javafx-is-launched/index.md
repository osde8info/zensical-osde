What is [JavaFX](http://javafx.com/) ?

> _JavaFX is an expressive client platform for creating and delivering rich internet experiences across all the screens of your life. And now, Sun introduces JavaFX Mobile, which runs directly on Java ME to take advantage of its ubiquity, security, and highly capable feature set._  

[Why use JavaFX Script ?](http://openjfx.java.sun.com/current-build/doc/reference/ch01s01.html)

> _Two good reasons are: ubiquitous delivery, and rapid development of graphical applications. JavaFX is built on the Java platform, which is available on everything from cell phones to supercomputers. JavaFX Script is designed so that the developer can express their desired results succinctly and simply. Where most programming languages require the developer to describe what they want _imperatively_ (tell me _how_ to achieve the effect you want), JavaFX Script allows you to instead express many things _declaratively_ (tell me _what_ you want, and I'll figure out how to make it happen). Declarative programming is particularly powerful in expressing the interactive relationships between graphical components, greatly simplifing the code and the development process._
