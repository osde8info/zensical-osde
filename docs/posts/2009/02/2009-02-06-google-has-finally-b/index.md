I just used Google to search for [JavaScriptWebServices](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=JavaScriptWebServices) and got 51,000,000 which was completely UNEXPECTED.  
It seems that Google had decided to split my single 'word' search into two separate words and if i want to stop Google 'splitting' my keywords i have to enclose them in ""'s as in ["JavaScriptWebServices"](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22JavaScriptWebServices%22) and only then get the < 10 results I waqs expecting !

So when did Google start arbitarily changing users queries and how can I stop them doing it again ?
