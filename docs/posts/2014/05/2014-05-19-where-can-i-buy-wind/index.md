you cant ! but by lying to microsoft you can get a conversion kit for #100 !

simply backup and restore a copy of windows 7 from another pc onto the pc you want windows 7 on it will say "this is a counterfit copy of windows" (obviously not true) ignore this message then click on the click to fix this problem then LIE to microsoft by "admitting" you have a "counterfit" copy (which you dont) and they will offer to you the conversion kit which consists of a new licence key by email and new 32bit and 64bit dvds by post
