just like the htc google nexus one android the alcatel one touch 4010x android also runs out of internal memory and becomes unusable if you try to apply all the google play app updates ! so just dont ! and thats after uninstalling each and every optional app such as facebook and twitter !

google really need to rethink the SIZE of their app updates for all internal apps that cannot be uninstalled to prevent breaking of all androids that have < 128M internal memory
