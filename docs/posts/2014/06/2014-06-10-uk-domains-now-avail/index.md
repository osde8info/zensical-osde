.UK domains are now available as well as the .CO.UK domain

if you already have the .co.uk you have the right to get the .co.uk for the next 5 years !

for example STEPHENFRY.UK Est Arrive "Three Strokes and You’re Out" http://shar.es/Ph3Jx

see also the worlds biggest domain name advert @ http://welcometothe.uk/

you can buy a .UK now from http://www.domainmonster.com/search/ or one of 4000+ other registars http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/registering-uk-domain/choosing-registrar/list-registrars

and according to the Daily Mail http://goo.gl/J42m8D

_The wholesale price is the same as for a ‘.co.uk’ at £5 for two years._ However _Domain names are sold through domain registrars, who_ may _set a higher retail price._

PS if you have a bigger budget you can now even get a .NINJA domain !
