it turns out there might actually be a "bargain" android worth buying from asda

the #29 alcatel one touch tpop 4010x is certainly not since it runs out of internal memory and becomes unusable as soon as youve run all the google play updates

the #49 sony experia e might be the one

especially since its still #68 on amazon
