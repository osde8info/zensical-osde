only just realised its almost pointless turning off #geotagging in goog android photo app if you have goog location history turned on and you are using google photo backup

thats because goog photos matches timestamps from your location history against your photos to auto geotag them ! and if you are google maps contributor it then asks you to add them to goog maps

and thats how i discovered goog photos auto geotagging

i think goog should add geofences like @smugug @flickr used to do
