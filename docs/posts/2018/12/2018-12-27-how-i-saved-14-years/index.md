how i saved 14 years worth of @flickr photos from the clutches of @smugmug by using @[cloudsfer](https://app.cloudsfer.com/User/Register?ref=yHq6sLeVGQrO) together with @googleuk #[googledrive](https://drive.google.com/) #[googleone](https://one.google.com/) #[googleshrink](https://osde8info.wordpress.com/2018/12/22/are-you-running-out-of-goog-unlimited-photo-storage-space-flickr-flickralt-flickrip/) #[googlephotos](https://photos.google.com/) #cloud #photo #backup #flickralt #flickrip

as you may know @smugmug will be DELETING most (apart from your latest 1000) of your @flickr photos next month BUT if you act quickly you can save your flickr photo collection (however big) by using [Cloudsfer](https://app.cloudsfer.com/User/Register?ref=yHq6sLeVGQrO) to copy them into [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)

get a [Cloudsfer](https://app.cloudsfer.com/User/Register?ref=yHq6sLeVGQrO) account connect it to your flickr account and create a [Cloudsfer](https://app.cloudsfer.com/User/Register?ref=yHq6sLeVGQrO) photo migration plan to [google drive](https://drive.google.com/)

you can then optionally use [google shrink](https://osde8info.wordpress.com/2018/12/22/are-you-running-out-of-goog-unlimited-photo-storage-space-flickr-flickralt-flickrip/) to convert your [google drive](https://drive.google.com/) (and [google one](https://one.google.com/)) photos into an (unlimited) [google photos](https://photos.google.com/) backup

Systems Used

- [Cloudsfer](https://app.cloudsfer.com/User/Register?ref=yHq6sLeVGQrO)
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)
- [Google One](https://one.google.com/) (only needed if you have more than 15G of photos)
- [Google Shrink](https://osde8info.wordpress.com/2018/12/22/are-you-running-out-of-goog-unlimited-photo-storage-space-flickr-flickralt-flickrip/)
- [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/)

Total cost £50 (only because I had to transfer more than 5G & 15G of data)

I have just saved over 32,000 photos (42G of data) from next months @smugmugs @flickr eradication program using less than 1% of my broadband bandwidth
