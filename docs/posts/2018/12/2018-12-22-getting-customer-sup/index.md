getting customer support via twitter can be effective especially for large faceless corporates such as BP, COOP, MBPLC (Harvester & Toby) and MS

so next time youve been double charged for a meal deal or been overcharged for parking in your local pub carpark or have a windows 10 bug dont get angry try tweeting first

my latest experience was with MS who did respond to me which was nice but asked me to resubmit my bug on a separate system
