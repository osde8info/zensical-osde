You may have a problem with existing links in that _attribution to amazon links placed on your site does not hold if the end user has to switch to a different country specific website to complete his/her purchase. Similarly, if you send users to the correct country website, but with an incorrect country’s tracking id (not valid in that locale), then you will not get paid the affiliate fees for that sale_

So you may find using the geo-targeting feature of new link builder helpful

_The geo-targeting feature lets you monetize any traffic from other countries that was harder to monetize earlier. In accordance with our Operating Agreement, attribution to amazon links placed on your site does not hold if the end user has to switch to a different country specific website to complete his/her purchase. Similarly, if you send users to the correct country website, but with an incorrect country’s tracking id (not valid in that locale), then you will not get paid the affiliate fees for that sale. Many associates use complex home-grown systems, or unreliable 3rd party systems to overcome these limitations. These systems might have trust, reliability and pricing implications on your business. The geo-targeting feature in the WordPress plugin aims to reduce this complexity and give you more control on your monetization of global traffic._
