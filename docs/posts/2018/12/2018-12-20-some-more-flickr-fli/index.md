discovered even more @flickr #flickralt #flickrip photo site gotchas from 500px, [everalbum](http://www.everalbum.com/), [imgur](https://imgur.com/), pexels and [shoebox](https://shoeboxapp.com/)

some sites only let you import (from flickr) via the mobile app, some of the sites only let you upload via the mobile app, some dont accept pictures < 4M and some of them dont allow PNGs

flickr really WAS the ultimate solution before @smugmug killed it #flickrip
