are you running out of goog unlimited photo storage space ? then goto

- https://drive.google.com/settings/storage

to check how much disk space you have used

maybe you have accidently been uploading your photos in FULL RES (goog photos does not allow UNLIMITED FULL RES backups) ?

if you have you can compress / convert / shrink them to a lower res by going to

- https://photos.google.com/settings

then clicking RECOVER STORAGE however you can only do this ONCE a day !

NOTE :

_Photos or videos will not be changed to High quality if you’ve uploaded them using:_

- _Google Drive_
- _Your Pixel_
- _Your Pixel 2 or 3 during your Original quality offer period_
