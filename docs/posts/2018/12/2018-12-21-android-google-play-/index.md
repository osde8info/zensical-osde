android google play accounts have massive inconsistancies

an android lets you install multiple google play accounts (btw you CANNOT merge the accounts https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/63304?hl=en)

- to install and run apps from multiple google play accounts
- to downloaded and switch between google play movies from multiple accounts
- to download google play music from ONE account at a time

YES switching google play music accounts DELETES all the music you downloaded from the previous account

you may be able to merge your music by downloading it to a PC using

Google Music Manager https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=2#/manager

or

Google Play Music for Chrome https://support.google.com/googleplaymusic/answer/4627259?visit\_id=636810137421969411-755980015&rd=1

then

re-uploading it to your primary google play account
