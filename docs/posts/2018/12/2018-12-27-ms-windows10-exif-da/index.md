_To view and remove photo EXIF data in Windows 10, first select the photo or photos you want to fix, right-click, and select “Properties.”_

_If you want to add metadata, you can select values and edit the “Details.”_

_If you want to strip the metadata from your photos, however, you want to click “Remove Properties and Personal Information” at the bottom of the properties dialog._
