why is @poptelecom losing fibre broadband customers to @vodafone ? because @vodafone charge £22 and @poptelecom charge £29 for EXISTING customers to upgrade and £21 to NEW customers ONLY #mktg #fail

so thats £70 / year more than vodafone and when poptelecom cancellation fee is £75 you'll only lose £5 in the first year and save £70 every other year

its a no brainer

except that the vodafone website has MAJOR bugs and doesnt let you signup so you have to call 080 8003 4511 instead

The useless vodafone website continuously says
