sometimes complaining backfires and you get your money back so thank you ? [Mult Cloud](https://www.multcloud.com/) !

i had hoped [Mult Cloud](https://www.multcloud.com/) would let me save / copy / transfer my 22,000 photos from flickr to googphoto before @smugmug destroy them all next week

but after trying and failing 20 times and creating 5 customer support tickets i caved in and asked for my $7 back and they gave it back to be WITHOUT hestitation when actually i wanted them to fix the bug(s) and stop it hanging after 62 copying photos instead of all 22,000

so back to the drawing board or alternatives.net as i call it
