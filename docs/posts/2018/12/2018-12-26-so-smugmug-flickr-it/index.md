ive now spent $44 on @[cloudsfer](https://app.cloudsfer.com/User/Register?ref=yHq6sLeVGQrO) (for 50G bandwidth) and £15 (with £4 rebate) on @googone (for 100G storage) to save the 35,000 photos you will be deleting from my @flickr accounts next week

note to flickr users if you want to SAVE your @flickr photos from the @smugmug  incinerator you will need to use

- [https://www.cloudsfer.com](https://app.cloudsfer.com/User/Register?ref=yHq6sLeVGQrO)
- https://one.google.com/storage

if you have less than 5G then it will be completely free
