thanks to amazon uk  todays deals i have managed to build a 4 node [tenda](https://amzn.to/2RdPNCM) [nova mesh](https://amzn.to/2Q19B7C) wifi network for less than £100  - one 2 pack for £40 (todaydeal) and second 2 pack for £60 (ebuyer assoc)

almost ZERO config i just had to factory reset one of the boxes and swap it to be master then all 4 nodes worked fine and as a bonus my 2.4G network is now 5G enabled

probably overkill for a 1 bed flat but perfect for a 4+ bed house
