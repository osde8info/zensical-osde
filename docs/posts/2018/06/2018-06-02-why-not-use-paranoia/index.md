lets assume i am a software engineer working at @alexa, @facebook, @googspy, @intel, @microsoft or @siri and i am working on backdoors for @cia, @fbi, @gchq and @nsa

lets also assume i am a chinese/russian sleeper agent

do you not think i wouldnt also put in backdoors for the chinese/russians too ?

proprietry software is dangerous it is potentially lethal civil liberty violations are trivial in comparison

to save and protect the world you need to switch to free libre software (such as @tezos blockchains) today
