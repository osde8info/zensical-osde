post office broadband (postoffice.co.uk) customer service falls short #fail

their website is down (they blame @btopenreach)

their 404 page doesnt even mention the pobroadband helpline number which is 034 5600 3210 (in case you want to cancel your account too)

their customer service systems are down (they blame @btopenreach) so they cant cancel your account until monday "can you please phone us back on monday"

they have a severe short term memory loss problems

48hrs ago they sent a letter saying there were no cancellation fees(due to price increases)

they just said you have to pay 2 months rental if you cancel !
