_As an example, only 28% of people identified a grey cloud symbol as meaning it was forecast to be an overcast day. Over 60% thought it meant it would be a cloudy day. But what is the difference between cloudy and overcast? When does a cloudy day become an overcast day?_

_The World Meteorological Organization defines overcast as being ‘the meteorological condition of clouds obscuring at least 95% of the sky.’ But is this what most people think overcast means?_

_81% of people also believed that a grey cloud symbol indicated that it would rain, despite the fact that our weather symbols use raindrops to indicate rain._

_So, it seems that despite the weather forecast’s reliance on weather symbols, they aren’t actually widely understood._

they are trialing a 3 word weather system
