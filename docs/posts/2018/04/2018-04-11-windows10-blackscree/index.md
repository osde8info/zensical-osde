Heres a fun new idea from @microsoft\_uk if your windows 10 hasnt been activated correctly "_you'll receive periodic reminders that Windows is not genuine. In addition, to more clearly display these messages, **your desktop might turn black**. You can reset it, but every 60 minutes, it will return to black until the issue is resolved."_

_Regardless of genuine status, Windows will still be able to get critical security updates._
