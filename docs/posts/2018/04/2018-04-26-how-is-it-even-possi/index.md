"secure" duckduckgo browser

"secure" tor browser

- tor 7.5.3 is based on an OLD version of firefox (52.7.3 instead of 59.0.1)
- _tor tries to prevent attackers from learning what destination websites you connect to. However, **by default, it does not prevent somebody watching** your Internet traffic from learning that you're using Tor._
- there are a dozen FAKE tor browser apps even on the apple istore

"secure" vpn

- [freevpn.org](http://freevpn.org/) is free but who funds it ?
- [zenmate](https://zenmate.com/) doesnt use openvpn !
