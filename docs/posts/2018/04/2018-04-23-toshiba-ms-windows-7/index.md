if you have a toshiba with ms windows 7 and ms office 2010 starter edition bundle do not throw it away (fyi ms office 2010 starter is an **official** ms **adware funded** edition of ms office)

despite what it says if you randomly goog the net ms office 2010 starter can work with m$ windows 8 and m$ windows 10 if you follow the correct procedure

The biggest confusion is that M$ have named the Office Starter 2010 installer app "MS Office Starter 2010" and this installer app ONLY appears while your OS is windows 7.

_IMPORTANT The Microsoft Office 2010 item only appears on a Windows 7 PC that has Microsoft Office Starter 2010. It is used to install Office Starter 2010 and is NOT the full-featured version of Office 2010._
