if you have set up your bf/gf/partners phone on giffgaff and connected it to your creditcard like any perfect partner would you can instantly disable their sim (by swapping to the spare gg sim that you always have in your pocket) and disable their number (by chosing a new number) whenever you ever fall out with said bf/gf/partner or they leave you or they leave the country
