_Several years ago, security researcher Troy Hunt sought to tackle the compromised passwords problem with his HaveIBeenPwned.com project. While Troy hosts a service that people and services can use to check for compromised passwords, he also generously made the approximately 517 million record dataset available for download. Using this data, GitHub created an internal version of this service so that we can validate whether a user’s password has been found in any publicly available sets of breach data._
