When you visit a location-aware website, Firefox will ask you if you want to [share your location](http://en-gb.www.mozilla.com/en-GB/firefox/geolocation/):

> _If you consent, Firefox gathers information about nearby wireless access points and your computer’s IP address. Then Firefox sends this information to the default geolocation service provider, Google Location Services, to get an estimate of your location. That location estimate is then shared with the requesting website._  

But if you wish to disable the feature completely you can follow this set of steps:

> - In the URL bar, type `about:config`
> - Type `geo.enabled`
> - Double click on the _geo.enabled_ preference
