last month it was the java (mains) plug ! now java is appearing in the [android dalvik vm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_virtual_machine) and [SalesForce java enterprise clouds](http://developer.force.com/vmforce) from [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/products/vcloud/vmforce/index.html) ! 

if you're a java newbie you might like [http://www.javaranch.com/](http://www.javaranch.com/) and maybe the java cloud really is the [begining of the end of m$](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/04/29/the-end-of-microsoft-a-door-opens-to-a-new-cloud/)
