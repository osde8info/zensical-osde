I've run update manager, and I'm prepared to ignore all the missing codec errors from gstreamer and totem and so manually installed VLC as well but I still can't watch DVDs on my HP Compaq Xubuntu notebook without xubuntu 9.10 using 100% CPU for 15 minutes and it then giving me a load more errors:

Upgrading to ubuntu 10.4 isn't an option because it stops my keyboard working and since the HP Compaq Windoz Vista "recovery partition" became useless after installing ubuntu 9.10 ! where is the best place I can buy a copy of Windoz 7 so I CAN watch my brand new The Italian Job 40th Anniversary Edition DVD that I just bought for £5 in TESCO ?
