Whats the difference between the two (downloaded and 'official') Ubuntu 10.04 CDs ?

- 733,419,520 2010-07-02 16:25 ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso (Downloaded CD)
- 733,726,720 2010-07-02 16:10 ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso (OFFICIALLY distributed physical CD)

$ cmp ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso ubu10.iso  
cmp: EOF on ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso

So the the downloaded version is 300K smaller but NEITHER have keyboard support for my physical or virtual hardware ! So could someone please let me know when Ubuntu are planning on putting back in support for keyboards as i find keyboards very useful !
