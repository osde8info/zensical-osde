I have been blown away by the latest Google Android layer & nru augmented reality apps !

With layar I can now walk around the UK with my Android on a 3G or wi-fi network seeing where the nearest Barclays Bank is, the nearest Post Box is and what houses have been sold and which are for sale in the neighbourhood !  and with the lastminute.com lab nru ar app i see can all the nearest entertainment centres such as 10 pin bowling etc etc !
