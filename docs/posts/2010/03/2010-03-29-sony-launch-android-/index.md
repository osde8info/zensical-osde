It turns out that the new [SONY Xperia](http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/xperiax2) mobiles are Android based while the new [SONY Vivaz](http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/vivaz) mobiles are Symbian based ! I guess they don't care what the winning mobile platform will be as long as its not Apple OSX or Blackberry !
