This years [Brighton Festival](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/5641403/BRI/Brighton-amp-Hove/brighton-festival/The-Brighton-Dome) is on between the 1st and 23rd May 2010. 

  

One of this years most intriguing events is one called [Flickers: Off the Path](http://www.brightonfestival.org/Event_Details.aspx?eid=3523) ! This has nothing to do with yahoo flickr but is all about using "flick books" to navigate around Stanmer Park ! and its already FULLY BOOKED ! Argh ! 

So BOOK EARLY to avoid disappointment really does apply !
