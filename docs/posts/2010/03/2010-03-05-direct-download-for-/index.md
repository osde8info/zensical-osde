I think the article [Direct download for Ovi Maps 3.0 without using map loader](http://handphone-solution.blogspot.com/2009/07/direct-download-for-ovi-maps-30-without.html) shows you how to use NOKIA OVI maps offline and without a 3G connection ! As soon as I get some spare time I'll give it a go and let you know !
