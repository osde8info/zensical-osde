Thanks to googles android mobile free libre open source mobile phone technology I can now leave dozens of apple iPod, iPhone, iTouch, NOKIA E\* series, NOKIA N\* series, Nintendo NDS, Palm, Symbian S60 & Treo etc etc flickr, NING & VOX bmn & smn groups and just focus all my efforts on androids ! A platform thats even lets me replace the system keyboard with a morse code reader has got to be the answer to everything !
