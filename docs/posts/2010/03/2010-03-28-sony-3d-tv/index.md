I saw a demo of the SONY 3D TV for the first time today in my local [Currys](http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/index.html) !

Its pretty impressive but you need an updated SONY PlayStation and you need to wear SONY 3D glasses to see the 3D picture ! See [http://share.ovi.com/media/osde8info.public/osde8info.10123](http://share.ovi.com/media/osde8info.public/osde8info.10123) for a 2D video of the 3D TV !  
  
And I can't wait till June 2010 or have the spare the £2500 reqd so I'll have to settle for images from these flickr and vimeo 3D groups in the meantime !
