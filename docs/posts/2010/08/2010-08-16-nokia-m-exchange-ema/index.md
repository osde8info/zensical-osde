You can try fixing NOKIA M$ Exchange Email unrecognised certificate problems with old mobiles (such as the E61i) by manually adding the missing Class 2 Certification Authority Root Certificate. For example if your M$ Exchange SSL certificate was bought from GoDaddy just open your NOKIA web browser and goto the [GoDaddy Certificate Chain](https://certs.godaddy.com/anonymous/repository.seam) website and click on the [DER Format CER certificate file](https://certs.godaddy.com/anonymous/repository.seam;jsessionid=VchE9-1npxo0GiJ7Dw6JQw**.s2p02jb?streamfilename=gd-class2-root.cer&actionMethod=anonymous%2Frepository.xhtml%3Arepository.streamFile%28%27%27%29&cid=129393) !
