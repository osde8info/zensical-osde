It turns out the trudge through 4" of snow to todays [Apps World](http://www.apps-world.net/ "appsworld") today was worth it. Not least for picking up a copy of the Mobile Developer´s Guide To The Galaxy (6th edition) - and thats not just Samsung Galaxy s!

Thanks to [Enough Software](http://www.j2mepolish.org/cms/ "enough software") it turns out any other potential mobile developers can avoid the snow and download a [PDF version](http://www.j2mepolish.org/cms/fileadmin/Developers_Guide_6th_EURO_web.pdf "MDG2TG") directly !

The Creative Commons Some Rights Reserved licenced MDG2TG is a great intro to mobdev on any platform and includes links to such gems as
