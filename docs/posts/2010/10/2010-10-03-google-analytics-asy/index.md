It turns out I'm not the only one wowed by the latest google analytics asynchronous javascript code:

_when the GA code loads asynchronously, it takes over that array and wraps those standard methods. Now it can take the commands and fire them back to GA and_ `_push()_` _can do more. Freaking brilliant._

_I heard a huge cheer from the Internet today and found that_ [_Google Analytics has launched async mode_](http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-analytics-launches-asynchronous.html) _which finally unclogs our browsers from blocking._
