Windoz 7 64-bit operating system has both IE8 32-bit and IE8 64-bit web browsers.

If you want to use the Java plugin with both of them you'll need to download and install Java 32 bit and Java 64 bit !

- [http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp](http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp "java")
- [http://java.com/en/download/faq/java\_win64bit.xml](http://java.com/en/download/faq/java_win64bit.xml "java")

You should see that the 64 bit edition of Java gets installed into

C:\\Program Files\\Java

and that 32 bit edition of Java gets installed into

C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java

To check if you are running 32bit or 64bit apps run task manager and look on the processes tab and you should see that 32bit apps have  a "\*32" appended to their image name.

Note there is currently only a 32bit version of the Adobe Flash Player plugin !

If you are interested in which version visitors to your webpage are using you can look at the http browser headers for the 32 bit browser

```

WOW64; Trident/4.0;

.NET CLR 2.0.50727;
.NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729;
Media Center PC 6.0; InfoPath.2; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)
```

and the 64 bit browser
