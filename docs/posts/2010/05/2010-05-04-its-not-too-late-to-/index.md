**[NING](http://ning.groups.vox.com/) will be closing ALL their free-of-charge BMNs and SMNs in Jul 2010 !**  

Over the last few years [NING](http://ning.groups.vox.com/) have built up one of the biggest 'free-of-charge' Business Media Network and Social Media Network customer bases on the web but they now plan to start charging everyone an average of $10/month/network from July 2010 !

I imagine they are assuming that their revenue will to go from £0M to £100M **within the year** - this may well be true - provided of course that enough of their customers don't switch to alternatives to [NING](http://ning.groups.vox.com/) such as [VOX](http://www.vox.com), [WebJam](http://www.webjam.com/) or [WetPaint](http://www.wetpaint.com/) than continue to be FREE OF CHARGE !

You can read aout all the new non-free NING pricing plans @ [http://about.ning.com/announcement/plans.php](http://about.ning.com/announcement/plans.php) !
