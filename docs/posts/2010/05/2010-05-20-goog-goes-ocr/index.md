Just noticed that when i take a photo on my android with goog goggles it also sends the photo to goog ocr ! I recently took a photo of London IMAX and goog goggles took me straight to site of the advert ("worlds first LED HDTV") that was on the side of the London IMAX !

  

And on a slightly related topic goog docs can instantly convert (OCR?) a PDF into HTML !
