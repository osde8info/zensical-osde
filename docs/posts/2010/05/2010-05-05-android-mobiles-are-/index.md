You can now get an android for only £20/month from two UK networks ([three](http://three.co.uk/Home) & [vodafone](http://online.vodafone.co.uk)) ! The downsides are the 24 month contract term and that they are slighter older HTC and Samsung models ! but you could always pay an extra £10-15/month if you really want the [SONY 8M pixel X10](http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/xperiax10?lc=en&cc=gb) android !
