## [Google Mail is becoming Gmail in the UK](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=159001) but if you are using an android think before you say YES to switch from yourname @googlemail to yourname @gmail because you will need to soft FACTORY RESET your android via the settings privacy menu to change the goog account associated with your mobile !  

It might also be useful to FIRST backup all your android apps to your SD card by download and running the Linda File Manager android app !

By the way this is the SECOND time I've had to factory reboot / factory reset my android in a week. The first time was because i loaded too many apps onto my phone (and ignored the low memory < 20M) warnings which caused my android nexus mobile phone to completely LOCK UP everytime i turned it on!

The only way to recover from a locked endlessly booting android is to perform a hard FACTORY RESET !

- Press and keep pressing VOL- button (or the trackball button)  
    
- Press the POWER button
- Choose BOOT options
- Choose CLEAR MEMORY  
    
- Reboot android 

I also noticed Linda Backup didnt backup my "paid for" apps and recover your apps from SD card you'll have to enable install apps from unknown sources (ie your SD card). Luckily google android marketplace seems to remember which apps you have "paid for" and lets you download them again even after a soft factory reset !
