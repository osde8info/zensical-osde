Pre-dating NOKIA's "[FREE sat nav for all](http://osde-info.vox.com/library/post/2010-the-year-of-free-data.html)" FON and one of it's [equity investors](http://www.fon.com/en/info/ourInvestorPartners) Google (F&G) have created the [google mobile app](http://www.google.com/mobile/google-mobile-app/) (GMA) that lets you surf the web with a Wi-Fi mobile phone from any [fon](http://www.fon.com) point in the world  free-of-charge !

Versions of [google mobile app](http://www.google.com/mobile/google-mobile-app/) are available for Android, iPhone and NOKIA Symbian S60 and other mobile phones and you can also use it with your regular 3G network provider at normal charges. It even includes a sort of proxy server that p/re/formats web pages for mobile screen sizes !

Simply visit [m.google.com/search](http://m.google.com/search) using your phone's web browser and you will sent the right version of Google Mobile App to your phone. 

  

I shouldn't forget to mention that [google mobile app](http://www.google.com/mobile/google-mobile-app/) is a web search interface with voice recognition !

  

Just press the correct NOKIA S60 GMA 'hotkey' ! ('c' on a 6220i or 'ctrl' on a e61i) then press the NOKIA  S60 green handset button while simply "speaking" the word your searching for and GMA will use that word and your GPS position to search the web for you !
