[Welcome to OpenSea - OpenSea blog](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/welcome-to-opensea/)

> On eBay, you have to pay the seller before they ship the goods.
> 
> On OpenSea, the seller makes a binding promise to sell goods for a certain price, the buyer makes a binding promise to pay the price, and when those two promises are paired up with one another, the deal happens in a single transaction.
> 
> Things almost always go well, but when they don’t, it’s like the deal never started. No one’s left empty handed.
