sign up for a smartmeter to get half hourly readings (maybe from [Octopus Energy](https://share.octopus.energy/quiet-cloud-437))

you should have HIGH usage for 00:00am to 0700am if you dont (see below) and your HIGH usage starts at 07:00am (and stops at 23:59pm) your ECONOMY 7 system is broken

call your electric energy provider to get it fixed

the secret customer service number for [Octopus Energy](https://share.octopus.energy/quiet-cloud-437) is 080 8164 1088
