Windows 7 updates still seem to be working but you wont get any new updates in the future.

The Windows 10 upgrade seems to work pretty well even with old hardware so if you are still running an unsupported Windows 7 PC its worthwhile creating the [Windows 10 installation media / iso](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10)

then when prompted by Windows 10 installer / updater for a licence key try using your existing Windows 7 key from the sticker on the back of your pc - you might get lucky - otherwise leave it blank

One exception i have found was an old [SAMSUNG NP-Q35](https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/model/NP-Q35T009/SUK/) with an Intel Core 2 T7200 which had multiple Windows 10 audio, video, usb & wireless driver problems:

intel 945 express

_Your computer's system firmware does not include enough information to properly configure and use this device. To use this device, contact your computer manufacturer to obtain a firmware or BIOS update. (Code 35)_

intel 82801 GBM/GHM (ICH-7)

multiple errors

intel pro/wireless 3945 ABG

          dead

audio

dead

you can get around the intel pro/wireless with a realtek rtl8723b usb wifi dongle (~ £10)

finally if your cant get your old hardware to work with Windows 10 try upcycling it by replacing Windows 7 with [LinuxLiteOS](https://www.linuxliteos.com/)
