the #bitcoin systems on @coinbase, @cryptocom, @revolut & @ziglu do not appear to be equal ? #fintech #blockchain #banking

it appears that coinbase and cryptocom have bitcoin wallets so you CAN transfer money but revolut and ziglu dont so you can only transfer money to other users ?

does anyone know why this is ?
