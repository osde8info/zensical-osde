Q

why is packages.microsoft.com/repos running slowly

A (from copilot)

That repo slowness is a known pain point—especially for Microsoft’s Linux packages like Edge, VS Code, or .NET.

Here’s what might be going on and how you can work around it:

```
apt install apt-fast
```

```
apt-fast updateapt-fast install microsoft-edge-stable
```
