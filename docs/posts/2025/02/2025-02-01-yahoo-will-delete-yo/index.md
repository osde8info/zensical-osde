_We’re so glad to see you’re back! Due to inactivity, your mailbox entered an inactive state. This means we stopped accepting your incoming emails. If your period of inactivity was long enough, we also deleted all of your emails. Now that you’ve signed back in, your mailbox has been reactivated and you will start receiving new emails again shortly._
