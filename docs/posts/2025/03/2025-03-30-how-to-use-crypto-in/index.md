You can now top up your Crypto.com Card using a non-custodial wallet via Cronos EVM Chain or Cronos zkEVM Chain. Cronos Chain is the first blockchain to power direct crypto-to-debit transfers, marking a major milestone in bridging DeFi with real-world payments.

**How it works:**

1. Connect a non-custodial wallet to your Crypto Wallet in the Crypto.com App via Cronos EVM or Cronos zkEVEM

3. Send funds from your non-custodial wallet to your Crypto Wallet

5. Convert to fiat and top up your Crypto.com Card

If the top-up token is not supported, it will be automatically converted to USDC or ETH, allowing for a convenient top-up process.
