Q

why cant i update my macbook pro to tahoe ?

A

**_Not all MacBook Pros are invited to the Tahoe party._**

Apple has limited support to:

- **Apple Silicon Macs** (M1, M2, etc.)

- **Intel Macs**, specifically:
    - MacBook Pro (16‑inch, 2019)
    
    - MacBook Pro (13‑inch, 2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)

If your MacBook Pro is older than these models, it’s likely been dropped from the supported list. Tahoe is expected to be the final macOS release for Intel Macs.
