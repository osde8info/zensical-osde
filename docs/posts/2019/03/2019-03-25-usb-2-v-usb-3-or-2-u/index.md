USB 2 v USB 3 or 2 USB 2 or not 2 USB 3

To get maximum performance out of your USB peripherals make sure you plug USB 2 devices into USB 2 sockets and USB 3 devices into USB 3 sockets

For example is a waste to plug a mouse into a USB 2 socket and you can increased your USB 3 disk drive from 30M/s to 80M/s if its plugged into a USB 3 socket.

So how do you tell ?

- USB 3 sockets are often BLUE
- Run Device Manager and Order by Connection
- Use a hdd case that has a power light showing you the speed (the SALCAR SATA USB 3 case power LED glows WHITE for USB2 and BLUE for USB3)
- Manually test transfer speeds in different sockets
