lenovo thinkpad (inc X220, X230) BIOS setup problems and BIOS update #sysadmin

having problems getting into the BIOS !

options to try (after pressing power button or while pressing power button)

- F1
- F2
- F12
- ENTER key
- ESC key
- ThinkPad key
- removing PSU then rebooting
- or someone has even suggested (for windows 10 UEFI only) "C:> shutdown /fw /r /t 10"

lenovo system update for thinkpad is now available for windows 7 and windows 10

NOTE : despite what the online docs say the windows store windows 10 lenovo vantage app does NOT detect same updates as the native windows 7 & 10 lenovo system update app
