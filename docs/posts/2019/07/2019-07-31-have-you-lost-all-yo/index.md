have you lost all your gmails ? are you only seeing the message "everything else" ? then reset your #gmail inbox #bug #fail

then goto

https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/inbox

and set "inbox" to "default" and click "save"

use this link instead if you want to see all your unread mail

https://mail.google.com/mail/#advanced-search/subset=unread&within=1d&sizeoperator=s\_sl&sizeunit=s\_smb

(there seems to be some bug with the "important first" / "everything else" option)
