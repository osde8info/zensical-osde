apparently @microsoftuk is blocking access to windows 10 iso downloads ! why ?

- https://www.groovypost.com/news/microsoft-removes-access-windows-10-iso/

and only allowing you to make an ISO locally with the windows media creation tool

- https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10

but groovypost claim you can still get an ISO by downloading from linux instead of windows
