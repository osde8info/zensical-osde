be careful if your child renames their pc some random word it may not be random #childcare #parenting #advice

the random word "despacito" meant nothing to me when my 10 year old renamed his PC "despacito" (actually "despacito 2")

from a quick search on @goog #utube it turns out that despacito is a somewhat innocent (aka modern) pop song which has had over 5 billion views and which may or may not be #NSFW or #NSFC but that "despacito 2" is 100% #NSFW and #NSFC

btw my child claims its a complete coincidence that he added the number 2 to his computer name (so i suppose at least his understanding of english is pretty advanced - probably from watching too many inappropriate #utube videos)

(you may have to do some searching on your own as i do not feel it appropriate to post the NSFW / NSFC link on this supposed to be family friendly site)
