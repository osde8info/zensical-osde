even @googleuk have bugs in their apps especially their #backupandsync or #googledrivesync app using 100% cpu and 100% bandwidth #fail

but there is a workaround to the 100% upstream bandwidth bug just goto

- preferences
- settings
- network settings
- choose 50% of your adsl/fibre bandwith as your MAX upload bandwidth
