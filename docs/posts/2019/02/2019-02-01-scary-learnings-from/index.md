if it wasnt enough that there were dozens of edurobot vendors at BETT2019 pushing 'educational' robots to teach kids about how robots will do the jobs that they will never have

now we hear (from @openshiftcommons) that @adidas has made it more cost effective (read cheaper) to make (sorry i mean print) trainers using robots and 3D printers in germany than paying workers in indonesia $1/day

so theres no need to be scared of AI or the cloud - just be scared of robots
