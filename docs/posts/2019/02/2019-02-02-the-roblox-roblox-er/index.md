the ROBLOX error code ID=17 can be caused by a upstream bandwidth hogging bug in the @googleuk #backupandsync app so ask your parents to pause or exit google backup and sync on all their computers and try playing ROBLOX again

@googleuk please fix the 100% CPU and 100% upstream bandwidth hogging bugs in your #backupandsync app
