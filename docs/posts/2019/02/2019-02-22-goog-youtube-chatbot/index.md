goog auto @youtube channel creator #chatbots and #robots

whats the deal with youtube videos that have comments beginning with

```
Provided to YouTube by ....
```

and ending with

```
Auto-generated by YouTube.
```

is there some sort of goog youtube chatbot or robot that record companies can email CDs to and the youtube robot turns them into a youtube channel and playlists with hidden videos ?

specifically

i dont think official answer explains exactly what is going on
