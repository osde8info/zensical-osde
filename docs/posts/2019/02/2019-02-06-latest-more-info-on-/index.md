latest more info on the pesky @googleuk #backupandsync 100% cpu #bug only occurs with SSD drives

two similar PCs one HP8440 i5 Win 10 Pro and the other a HP8560 i7 Win 10 Home so was it cpu or os causing the problem ! no i think it was the SSD drive as once videos had been copied onto HP8560 google b&s didnt use 100% cpu

steps to reproduce

- get 24G of videos (a dump from your dashcam is pefect)
- put on a PC with a SSD
- run goog B&S
- cpu goes to 100%

workaround

- get 24G of videos (a dump from your dashcam is pefect)
- put on a PC with a normal HD
- run goog B&S
- cpu does not go to 100%
