deleting users on @microsoftuk #windows 10 via wind sett accts is different to ctrl panel users

deleting a user account via

- windows settings ¦ accounts DOES not let you save a copy of user data
- control panel ¦ user accounts SAYS it lets you save a copy of user data but that does not include ALL the users files including the users the "VirtualBox VMs" directory

BUG

- the C:/Users/\[username\]/AppData directory is also not cleaned up / deleted
