Would premise owners please STOP saying a 3 \* rating is a negative review on google maps ! IT IS NOT !

3 \* = AVERAGE

and petrol stations, shops, & pubs will generally get a 3 \* from me whereas national trust properties will generally get a 5 \* from me

heres an ACTUAL unreplyable MSG from a premise owner for a 3 \* rating

_response from the owner : we regret to hear that you had a negative experience with us, but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around. If you ever need anything else from us, please feel free to give us a call or stop by._
