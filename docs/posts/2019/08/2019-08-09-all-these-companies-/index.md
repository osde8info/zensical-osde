All these companies have a #MSA statement ! does yours ?

- expedia.co.uk
- uk.hotels.com
- ebookers.com (UK)
- trivago.co.uk
- homeaway.co.uk
- ownersdirect.co.uk
- egencia.com (UK)
- silverrailtech.com (UK)

actually its just a "_non-exhaustive list of UK websites of Expedia Group_" thus they all abide by expediagroups policies

https://www.expediagroup.com/about/msa-statement/

in addition a vendor code of conduct is imposed on their suppliers and vendors

https://www.expediagroup.com/about/vendor-code-of-conduct/

with the threat that

_non-compliance with the code can lead to Expedia Group ceasing to do business with a vendor or supplier_

Whistleblowing

In addition the "_Expedia Group maintains a twenty-four hour phone hotline for employees to raise concerns without fear of retaliation. Employees can confidentially report any concerns, which may include concerns relating to modern slavery and human trafficking."_

So next time you book a "cheap" holiday maybe think is it an ethical holiday from an ethical company ?
