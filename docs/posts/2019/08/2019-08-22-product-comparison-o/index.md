product comparison of the day @BOSE OnEar v @BOSE OverEar #bluetooth headphones

- [BOSE OnEar](https://amzn.to/2KNXw6B) - £170 minus £10 AMAZON discount
- [BOSE OverEar](https://amzn.to/2No1Z1r) - £200 minus £80 AMAZON discount (so cheaper but better ?)

PS the colour choice "triple black" means you dont get "blue" speaker covers
