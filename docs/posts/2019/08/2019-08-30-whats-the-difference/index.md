- MS WordPad - comes with Windows 10 and can read and write .DOCX docs
- MS [Word Mobile](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/word-mobile/9wzdncrfjb9s?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) - is designed for small desktops & tablets and can read .DOC docs
- MS [Office Live Word](https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx) - is cloud based and can read and write both docs
- MS [OneDrive Live Word](https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx) - is also cloud based and can read and write both docs
- MS [Office 365 Education](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/education/products/office) - is "free of charge" if you have a .ac.uk or .edu email address and can read and write both docs

you could also try the "free libre open source" LibreOffice or Apache OpenOffice to read and write DOCX and DOC docs
