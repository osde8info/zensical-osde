_"As previously announced, Windows 7 extended support is ending January 14, 2020. While many of you are already well on your way in deploying Windows 10, we understand that everyone is at a different point in the upgrade process._

_"With that in mind, today we are announcing that we will offer Windows 7 Extended Security Updates (ESU) through January 2023."_
