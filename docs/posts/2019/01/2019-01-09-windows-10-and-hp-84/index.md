windows 10 and hp 8440w and hp 8560w hotkey support

make sure you re-install hp hotkey support to reenable screen brightness down, screen brightness up and ambient light sensor toggle hotkeys (F9, F10, F11)

YES that star with a triangle on the F11 key is the icon for the ambient light sensor toggle
