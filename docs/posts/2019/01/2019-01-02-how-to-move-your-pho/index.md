maybe you are using 45G of goog ie 30G above your free 15G quota and are having to pay google one for the extra space

well you can convert photos on your google drive and google one to free unlimited google photos cloud storage if you want

- download google backup and sync app on your pc
- enable google photo backup
- enable google drive backup
- wait for sync to complete (approx 1 hr for every 1G)
- disable google drive sync
- close google backup and sync
- drag all photos from google drive folder to google photos folder
- wait for sync to re upload photos to google photos

once you are happy photos have converted correctly
