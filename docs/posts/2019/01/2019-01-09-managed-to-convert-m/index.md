managed to convert my @googleuk #googone #googdrive cloud backup data #photos to #googphoto storage just in the nick of time before the next billing cycle #flickalt #flickrip

spent a whole week downloading 45G of 'photos' from my goog one / goog drive and then reuploading them as goog 'unlimited' photos i am now within my 15G free quota and wont have to pay another £1.50 for 100G next month
