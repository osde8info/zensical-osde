its a bit 1984ish but having teachers and pupils / students wearing body cams throughout the schoolday might be a help or a legal minefield

if you are a startup looking at entering the educational robot market the message from this years show is thats its pretty saturated

stand winner has to be the microsoft edu minecraft themed stand with 3M high minecraft trees

other tech vendors included acer, benq, dell (with a dinosaur theme), epson, google, lenovo, smoothwall and spotify

if you missed it today its on until sat
