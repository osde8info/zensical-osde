the dangers of linking your google drive #googdrive or google one #googone to your google photos #googphotos #flickralt #flickrip

the main danger / reason is

- _**if you delete a photo from Google Drive, it’ll also get deleted from Google Photos**_

(why would you want to delete a photo from unlimited ! storage ?)

if fact all the deletion rules are just too complicated (and you will end up using and needing to pay for google drive or google one space)

see (read ? & understand ?)

- https://support.google.com/drive/answer/6156103

and then goto

- https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/my-drive

to check your settings and check that the

- Create a Google Photos folder

setting

- Automatically put your Google Photos in a folder in My Drive

is

- set to OFF (or NO)
