_Windows 7 may reach end of life for average consumers next year, but enterprise users can opt for Windows 7 Extended Security Updates (ESU) which will allow them to continue using Windows 7 (Professional and Enterprise versions) with the above assistance (perhaps even more) until January 2023._

but Windows 7 Embedded WILL be support until 2021
