i suspect many people are now familiar with the all new @poundland £2 and £5 combo shelf - thats the shelf where the horizontal prices say £2 and the vertical prices say £5 so you have no idea how much a particular item is !

well there is a SECRET coding system @poundland use if look very closely at the back or underneath the packaging and you may see a number 2 or a number 5

and so a number 2 means the item is £2 and a number 5 means the item is £5 UNLESS its on sale in which case a 5 means £2

heres a photo of some actual @poundland items with the SECRET code on the underneath of the packaging BTW these items were on sale so the actual price was £2 not £5
