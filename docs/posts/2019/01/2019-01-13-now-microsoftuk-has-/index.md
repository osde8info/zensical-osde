now @microsoftuk has given windows 7 an extended life here are 7 ways they could improve the #windows7 #update #ux so that someone doing a clean windows 7 install doesnt need to spend all day

- fix the broken IE download website so you can use IE 8 to download IE 11 instead of having to download @mozilla #firefox to download IE 11
- fix windows 7 update so you dont have to download IE 11 first (unknown error 8007000E)
- ROLLUP the windows 7 update patchs so you dont have to spend a whole day downloading 180 patches (totalling over 1G)
- sequence downloads by date (ie 2017, 2018 then 2019) so they are installed in correct date order instead of a random order
- dont prompt to reboot while system processes (ie software reporter) are still using 100% cpu
- dont say updates are complete when you will get another 12 updates if you click check for updates again
- defer all malicious software removal tools to the end of the updates

next week we will look at 10 ways @microsoftuk could improve the windows 10 update ux
