_Device performance & health also includes Fresh start, which is a feature that helps you refresh your device by reinstalling and updating Windows—for example, if your device has performance issues or you have too many unnecessary apps._

**WARNING: Before you use Fresh start**

_Keep these important points in mind before you begin a Fresh start:_

_Microsoft recommends that you back up your files before making changes like a clean installation of Windows to your device._

_Fresh start will remove all apps that don't come standard with Windows, including other Microsoft apps such as Office, third-party antivirus software, and desktop apps that came pre-installed on your device._

_It will also remove all other Windows Desktop apps installed by your device’s manufacturer, such as your manufacturer's apps, support apps, and drivers. It will keep only Microsoft Store apps installed by your manufacturer._

_You will not be able to recover removed apps and you will need to manually reinstall these apps later if you want to keep using them._

_Make sure that you have access to all reinstallation media (such as CDs), product keys, license or login information, or other materials needed to manually reinstall and reactivate the apps or app-related content you want to keep using._

_You may lose your digital licenses, digital content associated with apps, or other digital entitlements for apps, which may impact your ability to use apps or app-related content you paid for._

_Make sure you meet the system requirements. Learn more at Windows 10 Specifications._

_If you just purchased a new device that includes Office 365, please see Download and install Office 365 Home, Personal, or University on your PC for information about reinstalling Microsoft Office after the clean installation of Windows._

_If you have Office 2010 or earlier, you will need to locate your Office product key. For tips on locating your product key, check Find your Office 2010 product key or enter the product key for your Office 2007 program._
