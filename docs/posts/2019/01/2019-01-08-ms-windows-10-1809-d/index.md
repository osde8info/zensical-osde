_In early October, we **paused** the rollout of the Windows 10 October 2018 Update as we investigated isolated reports of users missing files after updating.  We take any case of data loss seriously, and as I noted on [October 9](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/10/09/updated-version-of-windows-10-october-2018-update-released-to-windows-insiders/#RcpUwzQ5uF0IO7x0.97), we have thoroughly investigated and **resolved** all related issues._

_On October 2, 2018, we announced the availability of Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server, version 1809. Later that week, we **paused** the rollout of these new releases to investigate isolated reports of users missing files after updating to the latest Windows 10 feature update. We take any case of data loss seriously, so we proactively removed all related media from our channels as we started investigation of the reports and have now fixed all known related issues._

_In addition to extensive internal validation, we have taken time to closely monitor feedback and diagnostic data from our Windows Insiders and from millions of devices on the Windows 10 October 2018 Update. There is no further evidence of data loss. Based on this data, today we are beginning the **re-release** of Windows Server 2019, Windows Server, version 1809, and the [related versions of Windows 10](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=170043)._
