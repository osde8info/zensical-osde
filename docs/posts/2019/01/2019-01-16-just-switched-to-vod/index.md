just switched to @vodafone #fibre #broadband which has lots of options

you might want to enable split SSID and save energy / power by turning off / down all the LEDs AND if you have turned off all the LEDs there is a proximity sensor that turns them back on when you hand is within 2 inches of the router

Im currently getting 30M down and 8M up for £21/month
