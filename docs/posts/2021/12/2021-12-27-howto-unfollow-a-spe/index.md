_Starting today, the incoming Biden administration will manage the official White House account. You're currently following both the White House account and the Trump White House account on Flickr. If you wish to follow both of these accounts, no further action is required. If you wish to unfollow, simply go to the link(s) below and click ‘Following’ to select ‘Unfollow.’_
