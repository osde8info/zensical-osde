google will soon delete all of your Google Play Music library and data

> On 24 February 2021, we will delete all of your Google Play Music data. This includes your music library, with any uploads, purchases and anything you've added from Google Play Music. After this date, there will be no way to recover it.

> But, if you've made any changes, you still have the option to transfer again, so that your music library is up to date.

> If you would like to download your Google Play Music library and data, you can do so with [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/play_music?pli=1) before 24 February 2021.
