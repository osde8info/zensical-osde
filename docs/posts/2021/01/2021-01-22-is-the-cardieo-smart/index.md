well actually all of the above

the youtube adverts are complete LIES with photos of an actual iwatch, claims that their clone is waterproof, fake charger photos, no gps, etc etc etc

however the watch is actually partially functional and may be worth £25 and certainly not the advertised £75

make sure you install the CORRECT fitpro app from the app store
