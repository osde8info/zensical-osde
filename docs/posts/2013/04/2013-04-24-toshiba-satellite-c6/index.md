if you are rebuilding / reinstalling a toshiba satellite C660 windows 7 64 bit notebook from your recovery dvds there are a couple of issues to watch out for with the default toshiba provided intel drivers

1. The Intel(R) Management and Security Application Local Management Service service may fail to start  and generate errors in your system log.
2. The Intel(R) HD Graphics Drivers depend on DOTNET 3 !

Solutions

- download and reinstall the Intel Management Interface drivers from http://www.toshiba.co.uk/innovation/download\_drivers\_bios.jsp?service=UK
- DO NOT uninstall DOT NET 3
