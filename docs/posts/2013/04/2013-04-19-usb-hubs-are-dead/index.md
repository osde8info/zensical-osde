staples and tesco seem to have stopped selling powered usb hubs, maplin sells hubs but even the (£15) 7 port one doesnt come with a power supply (according to the packaging) but ask them nicely in the shop to open it before you buy and you might get lucky

pcworld ARE selling a powered 7 port hub for £20

but that one didnt work at all so i had to take it back for a refund
