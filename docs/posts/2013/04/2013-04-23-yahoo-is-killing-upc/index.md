forget goog killing its rss reader, the thunderbird rss reader always worked for me, yahoo is killing upcoming next month ! not a big surprise since yahoo haven't cared about it for over a year and let it fill up with spam "events"

so its time to move all my events to goog+ events or is there a better alternative ?
