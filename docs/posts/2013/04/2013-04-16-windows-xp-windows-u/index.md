m$ have broken windoz update for clean (re)installs of windoz xp

this is because windoz xp (and windoz xp sp2) come with internet explorer 6 which is no longer supported by \*.windows.com sites **including** update.windows.com

so after a clean windows xp (re)install you must now 

- get ie8 installer and install it 
- get wxp sp3 and install it 

then windows update should work
