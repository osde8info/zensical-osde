_Why is there no 64bit edition?_

_Technical reason is: this edition works perfectly fine on x86\_64 CPU for normal everyday use by our target audience, for users with more than 4G RAM, kernel-pae can be installed easily so there is not enough performance or otherwise reason to put effort maintaining two variants when this works on both the architectures._

_Non-technical reason: Education team is a small volunteer team, we don't have anyone on our team who care enough or has spare time to create, test and maintain 64bit edition_
