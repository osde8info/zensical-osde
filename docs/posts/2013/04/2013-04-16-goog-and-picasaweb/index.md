google have now absorbed picasaweb into goog+ so if you have a goog+ profile and you try to go to [https://picasaweb.google.com/home](https://picasaweb.google.com/home) you will be redirected to https://plus.google.com/photos instead[](https://picasaweb.google.com/home)

before you go ahead and create a goog+ profile make sure to read the rules about "Google+ Page and Profile Names"
