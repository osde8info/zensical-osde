in ubuntu & xubuntu 10, 11, 12 & 13 (especially in a vmware player vm) you may have problems with alt print screen not printing the current window and according to some of the comments in the "official" bug report https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/metacity/+bug/642792 it isnt a bug in ubuntu but it is actually a bug in windoz that it does work

one way of fixing is to create your own keyboard shortcut as follows

click

- xfce | settings manager | other | settings editor | xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts

then add your own | new | keyboard shortcut

- /commands/custom/<Super>Print

that executes

- xfce4-screenshooter -w

which will make Windoz-PrintScreen work instead of Alt-PrintScreen
