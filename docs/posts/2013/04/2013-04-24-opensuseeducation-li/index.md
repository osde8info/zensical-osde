fancy a change of gnu/linux distro ?

then why not try http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e

its opensuse based with kde interface and virtualbox and vmware drivers are preinstalled unlike many other distros although you'll probably want to uninstall the ones you are not using or both if youre running a physical pc
