windows.com no longer supports internet explorer 6 which means that update.windows.com does does work with ie6 and you may get "Error number: 0x80244019" when trying to update windows

if you are building a new wxp pc or vm you'll have to

- install wxp from cd or dvd
- download & install wxp sp1
- download & install wxp sp2
- download & install wxp sp3
- download & install ie8

then windows update might start working for you
