_After you recover your Chrome device, you **must** re-format your USB flash drive or SD card using the Recovery Tool. If you don't re-format your USB flash drive or SD card, you won’t be able to use all the storage space on your external device. Additionally, your USB flash drive or SD card may not be recognizable by Windows._
