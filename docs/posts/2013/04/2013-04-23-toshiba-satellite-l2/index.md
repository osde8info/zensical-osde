the best thing you can do with a toshiba satellite L20 celeron is to throw it away

my L20 has always been incredibly slow even after changing disk and memory and because it has an old celeron it cant run vmware player 4

vmware player 3 only supports the linux 2.6 kernel and i couldnt get opensuse 10 or xubuntu 10 to install on my L20
