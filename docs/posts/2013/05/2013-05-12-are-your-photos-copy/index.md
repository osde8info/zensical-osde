do you believe in promoting creativity and freedom and COPYRIGHT ?

if so you may need to consider switching the the social media network you use for images / photo sharing from one that encourages copywrongs to one that simply PINs (and hence preserves copyright) such as [http://pinterest.com/](http://pinterest.com/)
