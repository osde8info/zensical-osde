now is not a good time to buy a #DDR2 #notebook if you want to put 8G of RAM in it

- DDR2 8G (4Gx2) £151 [crucial.com/uk/store/partspecs.aspx?IMODULE=CT2KIT51264AC667](http://www.crucial.com/uk/store/partspecs.aspx?IMODULE=CT2KIT51264AC667)
- DDR3 8G (4Gx2) £54 [crucial.com/uk/store/partspecs.aspx?IMODULE=CT2KIT51264BF1339](http://www.crucial.com/uk/store/partspecs.aspx?IMODULE=CT2KIT51264BF1339)

so just add £100 to your DDR2 notebook budget and buy a DDR3 notebook instead
