one the biggest problems with (F)(L)OS(S) is fragmentation !

even the name itself suffers from fragmentation what do you call (F)(L)OS(S) ?

- free software
- open source
- free libre open
- free libre open software

do we really need 1000 gnu/linux distros ? or is that part of the price we have to pay for freedom ?
