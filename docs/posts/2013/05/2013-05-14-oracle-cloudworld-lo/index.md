oracle cloudworld london excel 2013 - the complete review

i had a fantastic day today at #oracle #cloudworld @ #london #excel and now i finally know which cloud to choose

it was interesting to contrast it with last weeks #salesforce #cloudforce but also unfair since catering for 2,000 punters is clearly easier than catering for 20,000

talk of the day was from @alanlepo but i heard good things about the mersk and the predictable peformance talks

just like the salesforce #cloudforce event the oracle #cloudworld event was very social media network and business media network focused but 10/10 for oracle actually displaying LIVE twitter feeds on their VDUs

at the end of the day it turns out i got the same number of clicks on my tweeted photo link [http://goo.gl/uZGzx](http://goo.gl/uZGzx) as on my oracle free 30 day trial link [http://goo.gl/g1uAe](http://goo.gl/g1uAe) and @thebizcouch even think there may have been a record breaking 2000 tweets from the event

if you are a cloud developer the cloud choice is now very EASY !

just choose what sort of cloud you and how long you need it for and if the oracle offer of a 30 day eval of any type of cloud is not long enough for you i suggest you try one of the following:

- IAAS - Amazon [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/free/ "aws") cloud - ONE YEAR
- PAAS - Red Hat [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/ "openshift") cloud - INDEFINITE
- SAAS - [SalesForce](http://developer.force.com/ "salesforce") cloud - INDEFINITE
