have you just bought a bargain [T60](http://www.morgancomputers.co.uk/product_detail/13227/IBM-Lenovo-Thinkpad-T60-14-1-Core-2-Duo-1-8GHz-Laptop-2GB-RAM-60GB-HDD-Windows-XP-Pro/ "t60") or [T61](http://www.morgancomputers.co.uk/product_detail/13065/IBM-Lenovo-Thinkpad-T61-14-1-Core2Duo-1-8GHz-Laptop-2GB-80GB-Windows-Vista-Business/ "t61") from [bentham ltd](http://www.morgancomputers.co.uk/ "bentham") t/a [morgan computers](http://www.morgancomputers.co.uk/ "morgan computers") for less than £150 ? and are you new to ibm lenovo thinkpads ?

if so then you may be interested to learn that ibm lenovo thinkpad thinkvantage is not just a blue button on your keyboard

there are also some associated apps that you can download

- thinkvantage productivity center
- thinkvantage system update

so after you have manually installed the intel pro/wireless 3945 ABG network driver you can install the thinkvantage productivity center and use it to run thinkvantage system update which should detect and install all the other device drivers you need such as the intel pro/1000 PL network driver and loads of other thinkvantage utilities !
