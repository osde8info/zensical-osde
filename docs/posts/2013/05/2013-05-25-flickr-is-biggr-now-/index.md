_even at the rate of 500 photos a month, that's still 83 year's worth of uploads._

and everyone who is already using a flickr free account will be able to see ALL their photos again and not just the last 200 ! and for the first time in 7 years i can now see the first photos i posted to flickr back in july 2005
