yesterday at #google #io google announced some major updates for google books, play, map, store and other android apps but they are now all so big there's no space left on my google nexus one for any non google apps !

- goog play services 14MB
- goog maps 13MB
- goog play music 12MB
- amazon mp3 11MB
- twitter 11MB
- goog play store 11MB
- goog play books 10MB
- goog goggles 6MB

thats a total of 88MB and because these are all factory installed apps they are all uninstallable and you cant move any of them to the SD card even if you have 8G free on it !
