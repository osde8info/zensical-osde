i've just bought an ibm lenovo thinkpad T60 with ati 1400x1050 graphics from [bentham ltd](http://www.morgancomputers.co.uk/ "bentham") t/a [morgan computers](http://www.morgancomputers.co.uk/ "morgan computers") for less than £150 and have been very impressed with their packaging and its condition and they used [DPD](http://www.dpd.co.uk/lp/predict/main/index.html "dpd") for delivery who gave me a 1hr delivery slot
