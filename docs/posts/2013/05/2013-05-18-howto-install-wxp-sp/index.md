You can only install windows xp service pack 2 (wxp sp2) on a SATA HDD if your BIOS lets you change HDD mode to SATA Compatability from SATA AHCI.

If you BIOS doesnt let you do this you have have to use a windows xp service pack 3 (wxp sp3) dvd instead  which does support SATA AHCI.

After installing wxp sp2 you can then go back into the BIOS and change the HDD mode back to SATA AHCI

Many thanks to @morgancomputers tech support for explaining this all to me
