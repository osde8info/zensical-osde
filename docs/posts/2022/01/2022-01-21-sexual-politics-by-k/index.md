_First published more than **forty** years ago, Sexual Politics is one of the most important books ever written on the relationship between the sexes._

_It has become a classic and world bestseller, enduring not only for its power as a feminist statement but also a superbly reasoned and gracefully written work of literary and cultural analysis._

_In it Millett brilliantly and wittily writes about, amongst other things, sexual theory, history, psychoanalysis - Freud and after - and analysis the writings of DH Lawrence, Jean Genet, Norman Mailer and Henry Miller._

_This revolutionary work shows how patriarchal bias is operated in our history and culture and is reflected in our mythology, religion, social mores and literature._
