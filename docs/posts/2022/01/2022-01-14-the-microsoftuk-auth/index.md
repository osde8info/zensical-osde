the @microsoftuk @authenticator app is so good it can even authenticate itself ! #password manager #security #sysadmin

its true ! not only does the M$AUTHAPP remember passwords from MS EDGE and let you log into mobile apps without passwords if you have a secondary android and/or iphone you can use the M$AUTHAPP on the primary phone to log into your secondary phones without knowing your password

so finally after 25 years i now have true sso with m$ edge & m$ auth on windoz, linux, macos, android and ios

to add an account via a 2FA QR code

- goto authenticator
- click +
- click other

now you can scan your 2FA QR code
