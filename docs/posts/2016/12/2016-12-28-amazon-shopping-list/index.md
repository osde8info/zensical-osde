It turns out an amazon shopping list is PRIVATE and a wishlist is PUBLIC

So you may find it useful to prefix your lists as follows

- D - Default List \[Private Public or Shared your choice\]
- S - Shopping List(s) \[Private\]
- W - Wishing List(s) \[Public\]

so that you see them in the same order in list lists AND the list dropdowns
