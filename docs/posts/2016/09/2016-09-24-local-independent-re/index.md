my local independent hoover retailer has restored my faith in humanity i recently bought some hoover tools over the internet that were not only damaged in transit due to hopeless packaging but didnt even fit

so i reordered some different ones from my local independent hoover retailer and went to pick them up from their shop and not only were they the right size they took my internet set in part exchange i dont think any of the big corporate chains would be capable of that !
