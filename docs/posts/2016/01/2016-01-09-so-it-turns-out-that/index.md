_We'll refund your return costs on items sold and/or fulfilled by Amazon, up to our standard delivery option cost only if:_

- _you received an incorrect item_
- _you received a damaged item_
- _you received a defective item_
- _you are returning shoes and clothing_

BUT NOT

- it is incompatible with other items you ordered
- if you found the item cheaper
