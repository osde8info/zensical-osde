it turns out that preinstalled @microsoftuk #msoffice #bloatware might actually give you an #adware option

for many years now i have been immediately deleting @microsoftuk  ms office  bloatware that comes pre-installed on many new notebooks thereby freeing up 500M of diskspace

it turns out that may have been a mistake since today i rebuilt a notebook and forgot to uninstall ms office \* and then clicked on a DOCX file which then then gave me an option to use MS Office as MS Office Starter 2010 AdWare it says it is not a trial and i will let you in 365 days if it locks me out like MS Office 365 does.
