HTTPie: a CLI, cURL-like tool for humans

https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie

HTTPie (pronounced aitch-tee-tee-pie) _is a command line HTTP client. Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. It provides a simple http command that allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple and natural syntax, and displays colorized output. HTTPie can be used for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with HTTP servers._
