Are you bothered by the windows 10 (1607) bluetooth icon disappears annoyance ?

It seems that in Windows 10 the bluetooth icon no longer goes grey when bluetooth is disabled it completely disappears !

To get it back

- click Open Action Center (the piece of paper icon)
- click expand
- click bluetooth

and the bluetooth icon will magically reappear and bluetooth will be re-enabled.
