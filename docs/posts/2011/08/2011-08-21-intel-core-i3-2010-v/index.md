It seems that most notebooks currently on sale in Sainsburys, Staples and Tesco are based on LAST years Intel i3 chips !

Intel 2010 [Intel Previous Generation Intel Core Processors](http://ark.intel.com/products/family/59140 "intel")

- Such as the i3-370M [http://ark.intel.com/products/49020](http://ark.intel.com/products/49020)

Intel 2011 [Intel Second Generation Intel Core Processors](http://ark.intel.com/products/family/59133 "intel")

- Such as the i3-2310M [http://ark.intel.com/products/52220](http://ark.intel.com/products/52220)

Perhaps Intel should make the difference clearer in their "Intel Core" advertising campaigns or maybe not as they'd never be able to shift the old stock ! And its worth checking exactly which i3/i5/i7 model is "inside" so you can decide if its worth spending the extra £30 to get a notebook with this years chip from DELL instead !
