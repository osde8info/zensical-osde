SmartBear [SoapUI](http://soapui.com "soapui") has a [SOAP Service Mocking](http://soapui.com/Service-Mocking/mocking-soap-services.html "soapui soap mock") function that _lets you create a standards compliant simulation of a WSDL based service just from its WSDL contract, which in soapUI is called a “MockService”._ _This can be run either directly from inside soapUI, with the included command-line runner, or even with a standard servlet container._

There are also a couple of SoapUI features that let you create a very basic [SoapUI mock REST services](http://soapui.com/Service-Mocking/mocking-rest-services.html "soapui mock rest services").
