yahoo flickr seem to have just imposed an [undocumented flickr group membership limit](http://www.flickr.com/help/limits/ "flickr limits") of 5000 groups ! WHY ???

so anyone who has previously joined more than 5000 groups (ie 5400) will have to leave all the excess groups before then can join another group !
