now you dont need a GPS enabled camera or a EyeFi GPS SD card because you can just run goog latitude on your mobile and goog will geo tag your photos for you AUTOMATICALLY when you upload them to panoramio !

_In order to be able to map photos based on your location, there are a couple of preconditions that need to be fulfilled._

_1\. You need to have Google Latitude Location History enabled, and you need to give access to Panoramio._ _2\. Your uploaded photo must have its creation time stored in its metadata (EXIF). Most digital cameras do this already, so you only have to pay attention that any post-processing you do should preserve that information._ _3\. You must have a Latitude enabled device with you and and make sure that it is active active around the same time when you take the photos._

_Panoramio will access your Google Latitude History to find out your location at the time when your photos were taken._
