[IBM will now be working more closely with Oracle](http://mreinhold.org/blog/ibm-to-join-openjdk "ibm") on the Java OpenJDK and OpenJDK will now be the official [Java SE 7 Reference Implementation](http://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/entry/moving_to_openjdk_as_the "oracle").

Also to further clarify the differences between the different Java's:

- the OpenJDK source code remains under GPL.
- the source code for the Oracle JDK is slightly different from OpenJDK.
- the Oracle implementation (what you find on java.com or java.oracle.com) will remain under the BCL license only.
