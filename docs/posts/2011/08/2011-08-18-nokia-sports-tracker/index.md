nokia sports tracker (recently bought out by endomondo) seems to have been reborn as the open source [goog android my tracks](http://mytracks.appspot.com/ "goog android my tracks") with the exception of track thumbnails which currently do not represent the actual track on the google android version

as well as uploading your GPS maps and tracks to goo maps it can also export them in CSV, KML and GPX formats
