i think i've finally setup apple icloud backup storage for all my windoz users ! the key seems to be if your windoz user is not an admin then make them one temporarily

login as your-user

run itunes

check you can see stuff in apple app store

run control panel config icloud

allow icloud, aps, apple photo share EXEs through your firewall

logout

login as admin-user

make your-user a non admin

logout

login as your-user

check icloud and itunes are still working !
