Goog Code Search ([http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/fall-sweep.html](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/fall-sweep.html)), _which was designed to help people search for open source code all over the web, will be shut down along with the Code Search API on _15_ Jan 2012._

So its time to switch to the following services instead:

- [http://www.koders.com/](http://www.koders.com/)
- [http://www.ohloh.net/](http://www.ohloh.net/)
