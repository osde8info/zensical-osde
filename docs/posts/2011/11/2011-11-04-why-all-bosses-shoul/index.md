Which UK CEO is going to follow in the footsteps of Theo Paphitis and scoop the PR media coup for going public about the BMN & SMN "virus" Yammer https://www.yammer.com  !  ([http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1210564/THEO-PAPHITIS-Why-ALL-bosses-I-did-ban-staff-Facebook.html](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1210564/THEO-PAPHITIS-Why-ALL-bosses-I-did-ban-staff-Facebook.html))

If you haven't even heard of Yammer https://www.yammer.com or it hasn't spiralled out of control at your organisation - then watch out it will ! Typical 10% adoption could lead to 30% a year later, then 60% a month after that and then 90%-100%  in the following weeks !

Alternatively you could you use it as an HR tool and sack the employees who are using it the most (and instead of facebook) between 9am-5pm and even more radically promote those using it the most outside 9am-5pm ! I suspect it wont be long before Yammer blocking corporates overtake the 54% that already block facebook and twitter
