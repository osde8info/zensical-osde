just started to try [bytemark](http://www.bytemark.co.uk/index "bytemark") [kvm](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page "kvm") web hosting and its looking good so far

the bytemark kvm lets me reboot and choose between centos or ubuntu distros and the single core virtual cpu seems to be quicker than my old physical dual core atom !

if it keeps going well i might even finally replace vmware server with kvm on all my servers
