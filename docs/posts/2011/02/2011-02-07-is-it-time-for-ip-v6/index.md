Apparently we just ran out of IP v4 address so it is now time to start using  IP v6 ?

Currently ~ 1% of the net is using IP v6 but thanks to [HE.NET](http://www.he.net/ "he.net") you can watch that growing daily @ [http://bgp.he.net/ipv6-progress-report.cgi](http://bgp.he.net/ipv6-progress-report.cgi) and even certify yourself in IP v6 at [http://ipv6.he.net/certification](http://ipv6.he.net/certification/) !
