[Apache Lucene Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ "apache solr") is _a blazing fast open source enterprise search platform from the Apache Lucene project._

_Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling._

_Solr is highly scalable, providing distributed search and index replication, and it powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites._

_Solr is written in Java and runs as a standalone full-text search server within a servlet container such as Tomcat._

_Solr uses the Lucene Java search library at its core for full-text indexing and search, and has REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON APIs that make it easy to use from virtually any programming language._

_Solr's powerful external configuration allows it to be tailored to almost any type of application without Java coding, and it has an extensive plugin architecture when more advanced customization is required._
