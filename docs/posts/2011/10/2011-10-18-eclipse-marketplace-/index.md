Eclipse Marketplace Client (MPC) is a plugin for Eclipse 3.7 that makes it easier to find and install Eclipse plugins.

If MPC plugin isnt already installed in your Eclipse then you can manually install it from

- [eclipse.org/mpc/](http://eclipse.org/mpc/)
- [eclipse.org/mpc/archive.php](http://eclipse.org/mpc/archive.php)

Then you can browse and download Eclipse plugins directly from the marketplace.

If you are using a database plugin to connect to a mysql database you may also need a mysql java connector
