it seems that if you download and login to the [box.net](http://www.box.net/) app on an ipad your box gets upgraded from 5G to 50G and once you have a 50G box _everyone on your team (ie with an email addr on the same domain as yours) can also have lots of room to share and access content anywhere, anytime, from any device and you can send 50GB invites to as many co-workers as you wish!_
