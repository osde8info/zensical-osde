i've been finding quite a few answers to recent technical problems and questions on stackoverflow.com but what i hadnt realised is that there's more to stack than just overflow ! it turns out that [stackexchange.com](http://stackexchange.com/sites) that owns and runs stackoverflow also runs 68 other Q&A sites including:

- [android.stackexchange.com](http://apple.stackexchange.com/)
- [apple.stackexchange.com](http://apple.stackexchange.com/)
- [dba.stackexchange.com](http://dba.stackexchange.com/)
- [sqa.stackexchange.com](http://sqa.stackexchange.com/)
- [askubuntu.com](http://askubuntu.com/)
