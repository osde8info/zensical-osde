when i tried to use windoz vista with itunes 10.5 to update my ipad 1 it got locked into "recovery mode" with apple itunes "corrupt ipad backup" and "error 6" messages but eventually after many failed "restores" and itunes download the 700M update twice at the fifth (any co-incidence ?) attempt  it just decided to work !

if you're having problems too check this apple technotes
