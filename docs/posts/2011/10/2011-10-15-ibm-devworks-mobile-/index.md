_IBM recognizes that mobile has created a new wave of IT innovation and as part of the IBM Mobile Technology Preview, we are working with our customers and partners to provide early access to mobile capabilities and technologies._

_The IBM Mobile Technology Preview helps foster innovation and explores the capabilities that are_ _needed to build mobile applications that extend and integrate into the enterprise._

_Initial intentions are to focus efforts on open standards, such as HTML 5, JavaScript and CSS3, and to provide unifying technologies to help manage heterogeneous mobile ecosystems with connectivity, scalability, manageability, and native, web or hybrid application development._

_The technology preview provides sample code and documentation that demonstrate capabilities such as notification and the ability to build hybrid applications._
