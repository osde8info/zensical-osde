There are many reports of problems with Ubuntu 11.10 such as the "5 app menu", grub, sound, video, wi-fi not working but this is true for dozens of GNU/Linux distros.

Using the Xubuntu edition instead of Ubuntu itself solves the "5 app menu" problem and it has turned out to be one of the best Live CD GNU/Linux distros i've ever used!

Maybe I haven't used a Live CD distro in a long time or run one on a PC with 3G of RAM but the Xubuntu 11.10 Live CD on a 3G notebook creates a 1.5G "overlayfs" ? "/cow" ? root filesystem which gives you plenty of space for patches and to install the largest of apps.

It only takes a few minutes to install the 83 patches (32M), Adobe Flash plugin and even the Eclipse IDE to create an incredibly useful live environment !
