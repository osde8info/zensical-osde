actually it turns out upgrading your ipad to ios 5 [ipad-ios-5-upgrade-breaks-ipads](http://osde8info.wordpress.com/2011/10/29/ipad-ios-5-upgrade-breaks-ipads/) is worth all the pain even for just a few of the 200 new features [ios-5-contains-over-200-new-features](http://osde8info.wordpress.com/2011/10/29/ios-5-contains-over-200-new-features/) such as:

- safari tabbed browsing
- wi-fi sync (just import an audio CD onto your PC and it appears on your ipad)
- icloud backup
- future updates directly via wi-fi (without needing a PC)
