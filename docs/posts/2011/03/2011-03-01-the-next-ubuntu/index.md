It is worth getting excited about the next Ubuntu (11.x) ? Maybe it is !

According to the [Ubuntu alpha2 release notes](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/natty/alpha2 "ubuntu") the next release of Ubuntu already has

- A faster kernel (with the '200 line patch')
- LibreOffice instead of OpenOffice
- Python 2.7
- Ubuntu Software Central with 'ratings and reviews'
- New XFCE, gtk,xfwm4 greybird theme (in Xubuntu)

Why not try [Ubuntu 11](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/natty/alpha2 "ubuntu ") today as a VMware Player VM or try it via an [Ultimate Ubuntu USB HD Dual Boot](https://osde8info.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/ultimate-ubuntu-dual-boot/ "osde8info") !
