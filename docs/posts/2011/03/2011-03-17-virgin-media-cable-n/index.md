Virgin Media have just updated my Cisco Cable Modem to a Netgear VMDG280 Wi-Fi Router however there are a couple of gotchas to watch out for:

- you cant run the reqd initial configuration from gnu/linux and firefox
- you cant run the reqd initial configuration from an ipad and safari

you have to configure it from a windoz pc with ie or firefox BEFORE you can access the internet !
