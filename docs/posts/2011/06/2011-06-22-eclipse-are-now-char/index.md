the lastest [eclipse](http://eclipse.org/downloads/ "eclipse") indigo was launched today but if  you tried to download it earlier you were [redirected](http://friends.eclipse.org/indigo.html "eclipse") to [a site that charges you](http://www.eclipse.org/donate/ "eclipse") a minimum of $2+ to download !

but now you can get eclipse 3.7 for free from  [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-classic-37/indigor](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-classic-37/indigor)
