I've been playing with [Amazon Affiliate](https://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/network/store/manage-your-stores.html "amazon") and [Amazon Associate](https://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/network/store/manage-your-stores.html "amazon") stores for a few years now and think i have have finally created a couple of useable stores:

- [my amazon sysadmin astore](http://astore.amazon.co.uk/sysadmin21-21 "amazon")
- [my amazon webdev astore](http://astore.amazon.co.uk/webdev21-21 "amazon")
