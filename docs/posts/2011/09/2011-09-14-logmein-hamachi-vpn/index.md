after installing the hamachi rpm `# service logmein-hamachi start # hamachi login # hamachi attach "your-logmein-email-addr" # hamachi` the final hamachi command will list your settings

if you want it to autostart on reboot you'll need to `# chkconfig logmein-hamachi on`

full documentation is available in /opt/logmein-hamachi/README `# hamachi -h LogMeIn Hamachi, a zero-config virtual private networking utility, ver 2.1.0.17`
