[yandex disk](https://disk.yandex.com/) shows us how ALL customer service should be done - by giving a 2000% refund / upgrade

An email received from Yandex Customer Support last year :

_You have received this message because you use our program,_ _Yandex.Disk for Windows, and have recently updated it._

_Unfortunately, an error was made in one of the latest versions that may,_ _in rare cases, lead to the crash of your computer's operating system._

_For this reason, we ask you to make sure that you have installed a stable version_ _of the program on your computer: versions 1.1.8 and later._

_We apologize if the program has caused you any problems. It is very important for us_ _that we keep your trust. That's why we have completely reviewed the process of_ _developing and testing our projects in order to avoid such errors in the future._

**_In order to make up for this error, we have increased the space available to you on_** _**Yandex.Disk by 200 GB.**_

_Stay with us._
