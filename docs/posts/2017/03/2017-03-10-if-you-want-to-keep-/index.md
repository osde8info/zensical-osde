if you want to keep using npapi browser plugins you might like to try the pale moon browser

mozilla firefox (and the other browsers) are discontinuing support for npapi plugins

- https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/52.0/releasenotes/
- https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2015/10/08/npapi-plugins-in-firefox/

oracle recommend java applets users try  Java Web Start or Pale Moon

- https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/java\_web\_start\_in\_or

JWS apps _don’t rely on a browser plugin, in many cases they can provide a migration path from Java Applets._

the pale moon browser roadmap says they will always support npapi

- http://www.palemoon.org/roadmap.shtml

_Pale Moon supports NPAPI plug-ins. Unlike Firefox, we will not be deprecating or removing support for these kinds of plug-ins. This means that you will be able to continue using your media, authentication, and other plug-ins in Pale Moon like Flash, Silverlight, bank-authenticators or networking plug-ins for specific purposes._
