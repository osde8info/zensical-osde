how can cc-zero possibly work ?

since https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ says

 

- _Unless expressly stated otherwise, the person who associated a work with this deed makes no warranties about the work, and disclaims liability for all uses of the work, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law._

anyhow it IS being used by

- https://unsplash.com/
- https://madewith.unsplash.com/
- https://unsplash.com/faq

and they say

- _The [Unsplash license](https://unsplash.com/license) allows for photographs to be used for any purpose — both commercial and personal. Blogs, art, book covers, tshirts, and more — paid or unpaid — they’re all allowed under the license._
