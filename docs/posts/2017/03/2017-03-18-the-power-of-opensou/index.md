maybe you have been enjoying using the opensource android opencamera app

- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.opencamera&hl=en

maybe you love the fixed infinite focus feature and maybe youre thinking i would like another new feature like "auto untilt" !

well thats the power of opensource you can ADD any feature you want yourself just get the free libre open source code, learn java and android mobdev and away you go

PS BUT google first as you may find its already been written and it turns out that "auto untilt" already exists -albeit with the wrong name
