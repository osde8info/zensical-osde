_You need to be covered by a licence to watch or download almost all BBC programmes on iPlayer. At the moment, there are just a few exceptions – watching S4C TV on demand, listening to radio, and watching films or TV shows you’ve bought on the BBC Store. There may be other exceptions in the future._

_If you are not licensed, you risk prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000\* plus any legal costs and/or compensation you may be ordered to pay._

what about tourists ?
