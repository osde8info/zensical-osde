imagine a time when meetings never go off topic - well thanks to power of the cloud, alexa, echo, goog, home, robots and some help from cia, gchq, kgb and nsa supercomputers that time is now

simply place a amazon alexa echo or goog home in the middle of your meeting room program it with the agenda and what the allowed topics are and every word of every sentence can be relayed immediate and directly to government supercomputers for analysis

as soon as they detect you have gone off topic your alexa echo or goog home will then alert you with an audible alarm or alert

WARNING WARNING you are deviating from the agreed topics please return to the agreed agenda
