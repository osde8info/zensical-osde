windows vista isnt dead just yet although after installing SP2 windows update hangs and svchost will use 100% CPU and 1G continuously for many days

so the first thing you have to do after installing SP2 is disable automatic updates

then manually install

alternatively the guardian recommend you throw away any amd sempron notebooks and switch to a free unactivated or beta version of windows 10
