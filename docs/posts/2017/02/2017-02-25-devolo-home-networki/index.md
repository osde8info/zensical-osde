you can use devolo home networking devices to create a home network without wires or wifi - it transmits data over your mains !

plug in one devolo device to your router then plug in other ones into every room you want a connection

and some devolo devices have multiple ethernet ports or even wifi repeaters built in !

and devolo 500 devices are backwards compatible with devolo 200 devices

in fact dont just add 500 devices to a 200 network SWAP the master plug with one of your new 500 devices and run 200 and 500 connections (or in this example 88, 126 and 236 connections)
