google for symless synergy download and you get a link to an unindexed page for symless sharemouse

- https://symless.com/download-sharemouse-for-free

DO NOT CLICK ON THE LINK ON THIS PAGE as it points to a download of an obsolete freeware version of sharemouse

the official indexed symless synergy download page makes no mention of this product

- https://symless.com/synergy/downloads

if you want to try the NON linux NON opensource sharemouse then download it from here instead

- http://www.keyboard-and-mouse-sharing.com/download.php

the portable version is nice in that it doesnt install anything and can run from usb !

if you want to buy the non linux non opensource sharemouse instead of symless synergy then you can go to their shop

- http://www.keyboard-and-mouse-sharing.com/docs3/09/shop.php

however symless have plenty to learn from their non opensource competitor sharemouse is 100 x easier to configure screens on as there is ZERO config required and no messing around with IP addresses or computer names
