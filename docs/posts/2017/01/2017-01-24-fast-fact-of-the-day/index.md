_**IMPORTANT: The official Kodi version does not contain any content whatsoever. This means that you should provide your own content from a local or remote storage location, DVD, Blu-Ray or any other media carrier that you own. Additionally Kodi allows you to install third-party plugins that may provide access to content that is freely available on the official content provider website. The watching or listening of illegal or pirated content which would otherwise need to be paid for is not endorsed or approved by Team Kodi.**_

But because illegal KODI addons  are now so popular apparently anti piracy organisations will now be targeting users in Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester :
