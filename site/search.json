And now, Sun introduces JavaFX Mobile, which runs directly on Java ME to take advantage of its ubiquity, security, and highly capable feature set. </p> <p>Why use JavaFX Script ?</p> <p>Two good reasons are: ubiquitous delivery, and rapid development of graphical applications. JavaFX is built on the Java platform, which is available on everything from cell phones to supercomputers. JavaFX Script is designed so that the developer can express their desired results succinctly and simply. Where most programming languages require the developer to describe what they want _imperatively (tell me how to achieve the effect you want), JavaFX Script allows you to instead express many things declaratively (tell me what you want, and I'll figure out how to make it happen). Declarative programming is particularly powerful in expressing the interactive relationships between graphical components, greatly simplifing the code and the development process._  </p> <p>See also:</p> <ul> <li>http://openjfx.java.sun.com/current-build/doc/reference/JavaFXReference.html</li> <li>http://blogs.sun.com/sundararajan/resource/JavaFX_for_Java_JS_programmers.pdf</li> </ul> <p>Read and post comments | Send to a friend</p>","path":["Posts","2009","02","2009 02 23 javafx is launched","JavaFX is Launched"],"tags":["java","javafx","javascript","mobile","ria","webdev"]},{"location":"posts/2009/02/2009-02-27-drizzle-the-new-data/","level":1,"title":"Drizzle the new database for clouds","text":"<p>Went to the PHP Conference today and attended a talk by David Axmark (co-creator of MySql) about Drizzle !</p> <p>Drizzle is the new database for clouds :</p> <ul> <li>http://drizzleproject.org/</li> <li>http://drizzle.org/wiki/Main_Page</li> <li>https://launchpad.net/drizzle-umbrella</li> <li>https://launchpad.net/drizzle-php-ext</li> </ul> <p>Read and post comments | Send to a friend</p>","path":["Posts","2009","02","2009 02 27 drizzle the new data","Drizzle the new database for clouds"],"tags":["alpha","cloud","database","db","distributed","grid"]},{"location":"posts/2009/03/2009-03-06-open-source-on-apple/","level":1,"title":"Open Source on Apple Mac OS X","text":"<p>The MacPorts Project is an open-source community initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the Apple Mac OS X operating system.</p> <p>To that end we provide the command-line driven MacPorts software package under a BSD License, and through it easy access to thousands of ports that  greatly simplify the task of compiling and installing open-source software on your Mac.

governance of the Apache Software Foundation. </p> <p>Apache OpenOffice is the original open source office productivity suite, designed for professional and consumer use. </p> <p>\"With the donation of OpenOffice.org to the ASF, the Foundation, and especially the podling project, was given a daunting task: re-energize a community and transform OpenOffice from a codebase of unknown Intellectual Property heritage, to a vetted and Apache Licensed software suite,\" said Jim Jagielski, ASF President and an Apache OpenOffice project mentor. \"The release of Apache OpenOffice 3.4 shows just how successful the project has been: pulling in developers from over 21 corporate affiliations, while avoiding undue influence which is the death-knell of true open source communities; building a solid and stable codebase, with significant improvement and enhancements over other variants; and, of course, creating a healthy, vibrant and diverse user and developer community.\"</p>

The SELinux type etc_t, is a generic type for all files in the directory and very few processes (SELinux Domains) are allowed to write to this SELinux type. This type of denial usual indicates a mislabeled file. By default a file created in a directory has the gets the context of the parent directory, but SELinux policy has rules about the creation of directories, that say if a process running in one SELinux Domain (D1) creates a file in a directory with a particular SELinux File Context (F1) the file gets a different File Context (F2). The policy usually allows the SELinux Domain (D1) the ability to write, unlink, and append on (F2).</p> <p>But if for some reason a file (./aliases.db) was created with the wrong context, this domain will be denied. The usual solution to this problem is to reset the file context on the target file, restorecon -v './aliases.db'. If the file context does not change from etc_t, then this is probably a bug in policy.</p> <p>Please file a bug report (http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi) against the selinux-policy package. If it does change, you can try your application again to see if it works. The file context could have been mislabeled by editing the file or moving the file from a different directory, if the file keeps getting mislabeled, check the init scripts to see if they are doing something to mislabel the file.</p> <p>Additional Information:</p> <p>Source Context                user_u:system_r:postfix_master_t Target Context                user_u:object_r:etc_t Target Objects                ./aliases.db [ file ] Source                        postalias Source Path                   /usr/sbin/postalias Port                           Host                          localhost.localdomain Source RPM Packages           postfix-2.3.3-2.3.el5_6 Target RPM Packages Policy RPM                    selinux-policy-2.4.6-327.el5 Selinux Enabled               True Policy Type                   targeted MLS Enabled                   True Enforcing Mode                Permissive Plugin Name                   mislabeled_file Host Name                     localhost.localdomain Platform                      Linux localhost.localdomain","path":["Posts","2012","08","2012 08 08 even postfix isnt se","even postfix isnt selinux compliant"],"tags":["linux","security","selinux","sysadmin"]},{"location":"posts/2012/08/2012-08-12-ios-apps-of-the-week/","level":1,"title":"ios apps of the week","text":"<p>ios apps of the week  </p> <p>including</p> <ul> <li>occipital 360</li> <li>PFAR - plane finder augmented reality  (point at a plane in the sky and it tells you where its going)</li> <li>HP ePrint and HP Printer Control</li> <li>dice roller</li> <li>rotary dialer</li> <li>file manager - turn your iphone into an ftp server so you actually copy photos off it</li> <li>national trust</li> <li>vyclone video aggregator</li> </ul>","path":["Posts","2012","08","2012 08 12 ios apps of the week","ios apps of the week"],"tags":["apps","ar","ios","retro","wi-fi"]},{"location":"posts/2012/08/2012-08-17-windoz-ssh/","level":1,"title":"windoz ssh","text":"<p>there are now quite a few windoz ssh choices</p> <ul> <li>cygwin/x</li> <li>mingw.org/</li> <li>putty</li> <li>msysgit.github.com/ - which installs mingw git bash shell (with ssh) and a windoz git gui client</li> <li>google chrome browser ssh extension</li> </ul>","path":["Posts","2012","08","2012 08 17 windoz ssh","windoz ssh"],"tags":["bash","git","shell","ssh","sysadmin","windoz"]},{"location":"posts/2012/08/2012-08-21-howto-create-a-webse/","level":1,"title":"howto create a webserver in 6 lines of javascript","text":"<p>howto create a webserver in 6 lines of javascript</p> <ul> <li>nodejs.org</li> </ul>","path":["Posts","2012","08","2012 08 21 howto create a webse","howto create a webserver in 6 lines of javascript"],"tags":["javascript","js","server-side","webdev","webserver"]},{"location":"posts/2012/08/2012-08-24-make-your-own-androi/","level":1,"title":"make your own android app","text":"<p>make your own android app (with no coding !)</p> <ul> <li>appinventor.mit.edu/</li> <li>www.buzztouch.com/</li> <li>infinitemonkeys.mobi/en</li> </ul>","path":["Posts","2012","08","2012 08 24 make your own androi","make your own android app"],"tags":["android","app","builder","mobile"]},{"location":"posts/2012/08/2012-08-28-json-pretty-print-wi/","level":1,"title":"json pretty print with python 3","text":"<p>howto pretty print json with the python 3 json module</p> <pre><code>$ echo '{\"json\": \"obj\"}' | python -m json.tool\n{\n    \"json\": \"obj\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>see</p> <ul> <li>https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json-commandline</li> </ul>","path":["Posts","2012","08","2012 08 28 json pretty print wi","json pretty print with python 3"],"tags":["json","pretty-print","python"]},{"location":"posts/2012/09/2012-09-06-bemilo/","level":1,"title":"bemilo","text":"<p>bemilo is the first mobile network designed specifically to be used by children and managed by parents. bemilo allows you to control your child's usage, including:</p> <ul> <li>Deciding who your child can contact and who can contact them, and blocking any unwanted contacts easily.</li> <li>Enforcing the time of day they can use their phone for calls*, texts and internet browsing**.</li> <li>Reviewing all incoming and outgoing calls and text messages.</li> <li>Controlling their monthly spend.</li> </ul>","path":["Posts","2012","09","2012 09 06 bemilo","bemilo"],"tags":["mobile","phone","uk"]},{"location":"posts/2012/11/2012-11-08-opendata-and-the-odi/","level":1,"title":"opendata and the odi","text":"<p>Open Data Institute history</p> <ul> <li>theregister.co.uk/2012/05/23/open_data_institute/</li> <li>cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/open-data-institute-appoints-ceo</li> <li>guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/nov/01/open-data-institute</li> </ul> <p>UK &amp;

has become a classic and world bestseller, enduring not only for its power as a feminist statement but also a superbly reasoned and gracefully written work of literary and cultural analysis.</p> <p>In
